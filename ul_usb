1 INTRODUCTION
This document serves as the instrument for the Mobile Computing Security Program to identify
requirements and assess risk, with the objective ofproviding an approval-to-operate. The
information required for this assessment includes, but is not limited to, a complete scope ofneed,
justification, concept ofoperations, technical specifications, configuration management and
residual risk relative to the device being placed into service. Once completed, and ifresidual risk
is deemed acceptable, an official BC will be generated granting a Security Management Plan
(SMP) for those device(s) described within, in the.manner set forth in the concept ofoperations.
Attachments 1 and 2 are "living" documents. That is they are updated each time there is a
change in the configuration, or when new devices are fielded under this SMP. Attachment 1 is
the Configuration Management control document that lists the specific applications in use under
this SMP. Attachment 2 is a complete listing of all devices fielded under this SMP.

Note: In the event that an 188M is not assigned, 188M duties are the responsibility ofthe
assigned security officer.
9 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
Configuration management is a process that controls and manlIges changes (ie., new
applications, peripherals, changes in configuration, etc.) to a device or system. By controlling
changes made to a system's hardware, software, firmware, and/or documentation, throughout the
system/device life cycle, configuration management is a mandatory, integral part ofthis overall
ยทrisk management solution. The 188M and IS80 are responsible for managing this process.
9.1 Incremental Cbanges
Incremental changes to the baseline may be vetted and approved byยทthe 188M. Minor changes
such as the revision number ofan application do not require IS8M approval but are to be tracked
by. the 1880 in the configuration information periodically provided to the IS8M in the
configuration management document illustrated in Attachment 1.
9.1 Security ArchitectureYl!!. Usage Cbanges
Any chan~es affecting the security architecture including the manner in whichtheD

The bestway to offer up our services to the locals is have them call you, then you give themO>rmy cell numbers,
and we will talk them through the process.

surveillance for which the equipment is requested: and
3. cannot obtain the requested equipment from other law enforcement agencies within the
state.
(c) The Director ofthe FBI or his designee may. at his discretion. gram a request
for the loan of electronic surveillance equipment upon receipt of a written rellue.t from a state or

(d)The Director ofthe FBI or his designee shall not grant a request for the loan of
electronic surveillance equipment unless the Director or his designee determines that:
1. there is no ,current need for the equipment within the Bureau;
2, it is in the interest ofthe United States to facilitate the criminal investigation for which
the equipment is needed; and,
3. the agency has previously not violated the terms ofany loan ofelectronic surveillance
equipment by the FBI.
(e) ~y loan ofelectr~niCsurve~lanceequipment shall bemade by written agreement

Section Chiefofthe appropriate Criminal Investigative Division section haying oversight over the
investigative progiam involved; the Electronic Surveillance Technology Section Chief,1
Laboratory Division; and the Office ofthe General Counsel. Ifsuch technical assiStance is
approved, the State or local court orders (where required) should specifically include the coun's
authorization for FBI assistance in the state and local electronic surveillance endeavor. Without
such approval, no FBI personnel may install the equipment or participate in the surveillance. This
