- Court found the information protected by qualified investigative

- Balanced government's interest in maintaining· privilege with
Defendant's need for the information .
• Defendant had the Product of the Surveillance: the
cellphone used in making threatening calls was found in
defendant's house during search of residence;
• Defendant did not need to know howthe technology traced the
geographic location of the phone.
• locating the phone in the residence confirmed the accuracy of
the geographic surveillance; .
- .Moreover,Defendant could challenge the technology used to
establish that phone found in residence was the one that actually
made the criminal calls.

1 INTRODUCTION
This document serves as the instrument for the Mobile Computing Security Program to identify
requirements and assess risk, with the objective ofproviding an approval-to-operate. The
information required for this assessment includes, but is not limited to, a complete scope ofneed,
justification, concept ofoperations, technical specifications, configuration management and
residual risk relative to the device being placed into service. Once completed, and ifresidual risk
is deemed acceptable, an official BC will be generated granting a Security Management Plan
(SMP) for those device(s) described within, in the.manner set forth in the concept ofoperations.
Attachments 1 and 2 are "living" documents. That is they are updated each time there is a
change in the configuration, or when new devices are fielded under this SMP. Attachment 1 is
the Configuration Management control document that lists the specific applications in use under
this SMP. Attachment 2 is a complete listing of all devices fielded under this SMP.

Note: In the event that an 188M is not assigned, 188M duties are the responsibility ofthe
assigned security officer.
9 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
Configuration management is a process that controls and manlIges changes (ie., new
applications, peripherals, changes in configuration, etc.) to a device or system. By controlling
changes made to a system's hardware, software, firmware, and/or documentation, throughout the
system/device life cycle, configuration management is a mandatory, integral part ofthis overall
·risk management solution. The 188M and IS80 are responsible for managing this process.
9.1 Incremental Cbanges
Incremental changes to the baseline may be vetted and approved by·the 188M. Minor changes
such as the revision number ofan application do not require IS8M approval but are to be tracked
by. the 1880 in the configuration information periodically provided to the IS8M in the
configuration management document illustrated in Attachment 1.
9.1 Security ArchitectureYl!!. Usage Cbanges
Any chan~es affecting the security architecture including the manner in whichtheD
I are used or the type ofdata stored on them may require a renegotiated 8ecurity

Hello all.
FYI, the basic SOP for requesting cell tracking is obtaining a Title 18, Section 2703(d) pen order.
I I
The bestway to offer up our services to the locals is have them call you, then you give themO>rmy cell numbers,
and we will talk them through the process.

Cellular System allows the reuse ofspectrum
within a region by employing centrally
connected base stations
Each base station wirelessly connects to
multiple mobiles within a designated
geograpbic area (cell)
Base stations connect to a MobileSwitching
Center (MSC) and then to the Publie
Switehed Telepbone Network (PSTN)
The system anows

1. there is no ,current need for the equipment within the Bureau;
2, it is in the interest ofthe United States to facilitate the criminal investigation for which
the equipment is needed; and,
3. the agency has previously not violated the terms ofany loan ofelectronic surveillance
equipment by the FBI.
(e) ~y loan ofelectr~niCsurve~lanceequipment shall bemade by written agreement
