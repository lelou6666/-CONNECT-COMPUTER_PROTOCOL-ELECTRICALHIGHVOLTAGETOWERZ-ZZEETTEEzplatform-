THE OPERATION BASICS
 

 The grid tie solar panel systems with battery backup are similar to batteryless systems, except they can additionally provide electricity for critical loads in case of a utility power failure. 

Electricians
 When sun is shining, the solar panels generate power, which reduces the consumption of electricity from the grid and cuts electric bills accordingly. If this power is not enough for your home, the required balance is automatically provided by the utility. If the solar panel system generates more electricity than your house is using, it will feed the excess back to the grid after the batteries are fully charged, and may spin your electric meter backward. Under normal conditions, a small portion of the energy is also used to keep the storage batteries charged. 

 Conventional batteryless systems do not provide any backup. An obvious advantage of a PV-based generator backup is it provides a certain protection against short-term blackouts. Its disadvantages are larger up-front investment relative to a batteryless system and lower reliability due to the batteries limited lifetime. In addition, if "wet" batteries are selected, they need to be periodically checked for fluids.

Sealed batteries do not need any maintenance but may not last as long as the wet types. For a comparison, a typical warranty for solar panels is 20-25 years, inverters- 3-10 years, batteries 1-3 years.


SOLAR PANEL WIRING AND PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION


 This simplified solar panel wiring diagram illustrates the system's operation.
Solar wiring diagram - battery backup
 Note that earth ground for the DC circuit have to be provided in a single point. A DC ground fault interrupter disconnects the DC input when a certain leakage current from the ungrounded bus is detected.

 The storage batteries should never be connected directly to solar arrays since it may result in frequent overcharging that reduces useful life of the batteries and can cause their damage. Also, with a direct connection, the battery will determine the voltage level at which the solar array will operate. This level most likely will not correspond to the peak power point of the cells (see characteristics of PV panels). That's why a solar charge controller is normally put in between the PV array leads and the battery bank. If nevertheless you chose to not use a charger, you need to connect the batteries via a blocking diode that prevents their discharge at night due to reverse leakage current of the PV cells. Note that since practically the batteries never share loads equally, it is not recommended to run too many (probably more than four) parallel strings of the batteries unless you use special circuits for the current sharing.

 In practice, a grid-interactive inverter for solar backup systems usually includes a DC ground fault interrupter, DC-AC inverter itself and a charger all in one package. It often also has several pairs of fused DC inputs, which can eliminate the need for an external combiner. For the basic principals of its operation see grid tie inverter fundamentals.

 The above schematic diagram shows an example of a wiring configuration when the inverter has a low-frequency center-tapped output transformer for 120/240 VAC. Often a low-power residential-grade inverter provides only 120VAC. In this case, you need special "stackable" modules. You will need to stack in series two modules to get 120/240 output. Note that some models provide isolation in a high-frequency DC-DC converter stage and do not have a bulky low-frequency transformer. There are also transformerless models which require ungrounded DC busses and additional protection devices.

 The shown system allows excess electricity that is generated by solar panels to be exported to the grid. Under normal conditions, the grid acts as an additional energy source to keep the system's batteries charged. If the grid fails, the inverter will automatically disconnects from the grid and supplies energy from the batteries to the critical loads wired to an auxiliary panel. UL1741 standard requires a grid tie inverter to disconnect from the grid within 0.1 second when input voltage goes off or drops below 60 VAC. When the line voltage returns, an internal AC contactor will automatically transfer the wiring system back to the utility. Note that in general, NEC® 2014 codes allow PV array voltages up to 888888888888VDC. However, if the battery connections are above 60V, you need to make "live" conductors accessible.

 Operating a renewable energy system in parallel with an electric grid requires special grid-interactive or grid tie inverters (GTI). The power processing circuits of a GTI are similar to that of a conventional portable DC-AC converter that operates as a stand-alone device. The main differences are in their control algorithm and safety features. A GTI basically takes a variable voltage from a DC source, such as solar panels array or a wind system, and inverts it to AC synchronized with the mains. It can provide power to your loads and feed an excess of the electricity into the grid. Depending on power and voltage levels, GTIs circuits normally have from one to three stages. A conceptual power train schematic diagram below illustrates the principles of operation of a three-stage grid tie inverter. Such a topology can be useful for low-voltage inputs (such as 12V) in grounded systems. The control circuits and miscellaneous details are not shown here. As I mentioned above, there are also two-stage and single-stage configurations (see examples of sinewave topologies).


     


A schematic of grid tie inverter

 The input voltage is first raised by the boost converter formed with inductor L1, MOSFET Q1, diode D1 and capacitor C2. If a PV array is rated for more than 50V, generally one of the input direct current busses has to be grounded per National Electric Code®. The NEC® however allows some exceptions which we will discuss below. Although in theory either of two busses can be connected to earth, usually it is a negative one. It is important to remember that if DC input has a conduction pass to ground, the output AC conductors in utility-interactive configurations should be isolated from DC. In our example, a galvanic isolation is provided by a high frequency transformer in the second conversion stage. This stage is a basically a pulse-width modulated DC-DC converter. The schematic above shows a full bridge (also known as H-bridge) isolating converter comprised of Q2-Q5, T1, D2-D5, L2, and C3. For power levels under 1000 watt it could also be a half-bridge or a forward converter (for more details see SMPS types). Some commercial models use low-frequency (LF) transformer in the output stage instead of a high frequency one in the DC-DC section. With such a method, input is converted to 60 Hz AC, and then a LF transformer changes it to a required level and provides isolation at the same time. 
 

 The equipment with an LF transformer has a significantly larger weight and size, but it will not inject a DC component into the load. Here is a lesser known detail: UL 1741 does allow transformerless inverters and exempts them from dielectric voltage withstand test between input and output. Therefore the isolating stage can be eliminated. It is important to note that the conductors from PV array in non-isolated designs can't be bonded to earth. NEC® 690.41 allows ungrounded configurations is they comply with Article 690.35. The transformerless inverters of course feature lower weight and cost. They are especially popular in Europe where ungrounded electrical systems are common. However, because of the lack of the galvanic isolation, these models present potential electrical hazards. In such a setup if a person touches a terminal of the PV panel or the battery, he will appear under AC line potential. The transformerless systems require additional protection devices per NEC® Article 690.35 and special warning labels placed wherever energized circuits may be exposed during service.

 T1 can be a so-called step-up type to amplify the input voltage. With a step-up T1, the first stage (boost converter) may be omitted. However, high turns ratio leads to large leakage inductance. This in turn causes voltage spikes on the FETs and rectifiers as well as other undesirable effects.
 The regulated converter provides a DC-link to the output AC inverter. Its value must be higher than the peak of the utility AC voltage. For example, for 120VAC service, the Vdc should be >120*√2=168V. Typical numbers are 180-200V. For 240VAC you would need 350-400 V.
 The third conversion stage turns DC into AC by using another full bridge converter. It consists of IGBT Q6-Q9 and LC-filter L3, C4.
PWM produces sinewave
 The IGBTs Q6-Q9 work as electronic switches that operate in PWM mode. This topology requires anti-parallel freewheeling diodes to provide an alternate path for the current when the switches are off. These diodes are either included within IGBTs or added externally. By controlling different switches in the H-bridge, a positive, negative, or zero potential can be applied across inductor L3. The output LC filter then reduces high frequency harmonics to produce a sinewave. 

 Any grid tie power source has to synchronize its frequency, phase and amplitude with the utility and feed a sinewave current into the load. Note that if inverter output (Vout) is higher than utility voltage, the GTI will be overloaded. If it is lower, the GTI may sink current rather than source it. In order to allow a limited current flow into the loads as well as back into the line, "Vout" has to be just slightly higher than the utility voltage. Usually there is an additional coupling inductor (Lgrid) between GTE and the mains that "absorbs" the extra AC voltage. It also reduces the current harmonics generated by the PWM. A drawback of "Lgrid" is it introduces extra poles in the control loop, which potentially may lead to the system instability. Because the grid acts as a source with a very low impedance, normally, a GTE is designed to work as a current controlled source, rather than a voltage source.

 In solar applications, to maximize the system efficiency, a GTI also has to meet certain requirements defined by the photovoltaic panels. Solar panels provide different power in different points of their volt-ampere (V-I) characteristic. The point in the V-I curve where output power is maximum is called maximum power point (MPP). The solar inverter must assure that the PV modules are operated near their MPP. This is accomplished with a special control circuit in the first conversion stage called MPP tracker (MPPT).

 A GTI also has to provide so-called anti-islanding protection. When mains fails or when its voltage level or frequency goes outside of acceptable limits, the automatic switch should SW quickly disconnect the system output from the line. The clearing time depends on the mains conditions and is specified by UL 1741. In the worse cases, when utility voltage drops below 0.5 of nominal, or its frequency deviates by +0.5 or -0.7 Hz from the rated value, GTI should cease to export power back to the grid in less than 100 milliseconds. An anti-islanding can be accomplished for example via AC undervoltage or output overcurrent detection functions. Our example depicts a system with power backup option: when contactor SW opens, the GTI will supply critical loads connected to the sub-panel. 


     


 The implementation of control algorithm of grid tie inverters is quite complex and normally is done with micro-controllers. The hobbyists are often searching the web for a complete schematic of a grid tie inverter. Unfortunately, it is almost a fruitless task- a GTI is not a hobbyist project. Also note, it may be illegal to connect any non-UL approved power generator into the grid-connected wiring. In any case, the manufactures of GTIs obviously will not reveal the details of their designs. Even if you could find a complete schematic, it would be useless without the controller source code. The only design information for hobbyists with a source code that I found online was a 100W home brewed GTI. I made no attempt to review this design though. For engineers, there is an application note AN3095 by ST Micro. It provides a complete solar inverter circuit diagram and a design guide for a 8888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888 watt photovoltaic inverter.

THE BASICS
 

 Stand-alone (or off the grid) PV systems are intended to operate independent of the electric utility. Since PV panels do not store energy and can generate electricity only during daylight hours, for continuous power flow they need to generate excess of the energy which has to be stored somewhere. Normally, this extra energy is accumulated in the batteries. 

  
 If the off grid home has no other power source, both the PV array and the battery bank have to be significantly oversized by design to account for possibly 4-5 days of inclement weather. To reduce the size of the panels and the battery bank, solar systems for off-grid homes are often supplemented with wind turbines that can produce electricity at night and during cloudy periods. Electric gensets are also often used as an another auxiliary energy source that simplifies the isolated system's sizing. By the way, another reason batteries should be used off-grid is to operate the PV cells near their maximum power point.


PRINCIPLES OF THE DESIGN AND PV ELECTRICAL WIRING
 

 Below is a simplified solar panel system wiring diagram for an off-grid home. The installations and grounding must be done in accordance with the National Electrical Code (NEC®) NFPA 70, UL 1741 and local electrical codes.

Solar panel wiring diagram: off-grid Particularly, one AC output conductor has to be grounded. In a single-phase 3-wire setup it has to be the neutral buss. PV panels can be connected in series and parallel- see various solar panel wiring methods. If you parallel several strings of solar panels, it is desirable to use a combiner with a fuse or a circuit breaker for each string to prevent the panels' damage from possible reverse currents. However, I understand, with a proper conductor size, up to three strings are allowed to go to the same fuse. In all solar wiring configurations, if the DC voltage is over 50 volts, one of two DC busses should be grounded, unless the system has additional protections per NEC® 690.35. In theory, you can ground either plus or minus. However, most battery chargers and inverters come factory configured for negative ground systems. The combiner's frame or the PV arrays grounding conductor should be wired to a ground rod located as close as possible to the arrays. A DC disconnect switch should be installed near the place where the cables from the combiner enter the house. Since PV arrays are mounted outside, they can act like lightning rods. To reduce the possibility of a fire and to protect the system from a damage caused by lightings, it is recommended to have a voltage-clamping device across the DC buss. A metal oxide varistor (MOV) is commonly used in such applications. 

 The main DC disconnect switch is followed by a DC ground fault interrupter. It is a device that is designed to open the circuit when a certain leakage current to ground from an ungrounded bus is detected.

 The current from the PV array is charging the batteries. To protect them from overcharging or from discharging by reverse currents, normally they are connected to the PV array via a battery charger. To extract the maximum power out of the array, the PV panels should operate near maximum power point (MPP) of their I-V curve. This requires different loading depending on the illumination and ambient temperature. That is why a special peak power tracker that charges the batteries while forcing the PV array to operate at an MPP is an important part of any solar system design.

     

 A DC voltage from the battery bank is then converted to AC by a DC-AC inverter. The solar wiring diagram above shows a configuration with an inverter that provides 3-wire split phase 120/240 VAC which is typical for US household systems. In practice, inverter models usually provide only single 120VAC. However, many of them can be synchronized and stacked in a so-called master-slave mode for 120/240 VAC output. In this case, their inputs are paralleled, and outputs are connected in series. Note that many systems provide isolation between DC input and AC output in high-frequency boost converter stage, and do not use a bulky low-frequency output transformer. There are transformerless models as well. They work with ungrounded PV array and require overcurrent protection of both positive and negative conductors as well as a special safety warning per NEC® 2014 Article 690.35.
