Peoplesoft: Populating Data into Grid...☑

we would see how to populate a Grid dynamically using PeopleCode. Here we use a Dynamic View SGK_VCHR_DVW as the main record of the Grid. The grid is placed on level 1 of a secondary page and is populated using Peoplecode written in the Activate event of the secondary page.

Hi Dhev,

If you bind the DataGrid to a list source, you could search the value that you want in the source, and get the DataGridRow instance by DataGrid.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromIndex/ContainerFromItem. Then you could use DataGridRow.BringIntoView() to set the result rows/cells scroll into view.

Sincerely,

Bob Bao

Thanks for ur reply dude,

           I already tried with your solution and also I had found an answer....

But It makes me very slow and also very inefficient ...

Please try to teach me any right way....

My working code as follows,

  private void txt_search_TextChanged_1(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e)
    {
      
      if ( sender is TextBox ) 
      {
 
        for (int i = 0; i < grd_master.Items.Count; i++) 
        {

           DataGridRow row = (DataGridRow)grd_master.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromIndex(i);
           if (row == null)
           {
         
             grd_master.ScrollIntoView(grd_master.Items[i]);
             WaitFor(TimeSpan.Zero, DispatcherPriority.SystemIdle);

             row = (DataGridRow)grd_master.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromIndex(i);
           }
           TextBlock cellcontent;

             cellcontent = grd_master.Columns[0].GetCellContent(row) as TextBlock;

          if (cellcontent != null && cellcontent.Text.ToString().ToUpper().StartsWith(txt_search.Text.ToUpper())) 
          { 
            object item = grd_master.Items[i]; 
            grd_master.SelectedItem = item; 
            grd_master.ScrollIntoView(item); 
            break; 
          } 
        }

Hi,

TextChanged may lead the performance loss, try to add button "Search" and do searching in the click event.

Or you could search the content in the ItemsSource, and get the result Item; it is not good to search content in the DataGrid directly.

Sincerely,

Bob Bao
