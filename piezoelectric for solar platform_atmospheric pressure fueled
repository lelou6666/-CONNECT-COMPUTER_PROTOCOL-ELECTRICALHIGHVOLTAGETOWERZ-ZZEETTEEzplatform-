which are off-the-shelf or custom designed for a specific application.
What are ICP® sensors?
Integrated Circuit Piezoelectric (ICP®) sensors contain built-in microelectronic signal conditioning circuitry – yet operate over just
two wires. This circuitry requires constant current excitation and serves to convert the high-impedance charge signal generated
by the piezoelectric crystal into a low-impedance voltage signal, for ease of signal transmission and analysis. Low-cost coaxial
or two-wire cables may be utilized with ICP® sensors. Signal fidelity is relatively unaffected by contamination or moisture.
ICP® sensors offer trouble-free operation in dirty, industrial environments or submerged in liquids.
Generally, ICP® sensors are more cost effective and easier to use than charge output piezoelectric sensors; however, their
temperature range is limited by the survivability of the built-in microelectronic circuitry.

Industrial Vibration Monitoring
The IMI Sensors division of PCB® offers a vast selection of industrial accelerometers, vibration sensors, vibration switches, vibration
transmitters, switch boxes, cables, and accessories for industrial and shipboard machinery health monitoring, analysis, diagnostics, and
protection. Sensors are available with choice of connector, integral cable, temperature signal output, velocity signal output, and hazardous
area approvals. Determining machinery health through vibration monitoring has proven effective for maintenance planning, reducing
downtime, and avoiding catastrophic loss. Whether it’s a cooling tower fan motor or a paper machine calendar bearing, we can help, with
sensors that are off-the-shelf or custom designed for a specific application.
What is an “industrial” accelerometer?
Industrial accelerometers are built to endure the rigors of harsh factory environments. They are typically constructed with
stainless steel housings to survive exposure to corrosive chemicals. Welded construction and hermetic sealing guard against any
influx of dirt, oil, and other contaminants. Heavy duty electrical connectors are used to permit interface with strong, durable
cables. Sealed, integral cables may be utilized to tolerate exposure to fluids, wash-down conditions, or submersion. Armored
cables offer further protection frommetal chips or being pinched or crushed.
Additionally, filtering is normally included to guard against RF interference caused by wireless communication equipment and
high frequency saturation. Electrical case isolation and faraday shielding are used to protect against electromagnetic
interference, surface noise pickup, and ground loop problems. Additional circuitry is normally included to guard against damage
from mis-wiring and exposure to electrostatic discharge. These attributes permit industrial accelerometers to provide
uncorrupted measurements and years of trouble-free, unattended service.

PCB® offers both externally polarized and prepolarized (also know as “electret”) microphones. Both types require a preamplifier for
operation; however, prepolarized types may be powered with constant current (2-20 mA) ICP® sensor signal conditioners and coaxial cables
for an overall lower cost-per-channel. Externally polarized microphones require a 200 V polarization voltage. Free-field, random incidence,
and pressure response versions are available for each microphone type. All microphones are individually tested for performance. A2LA
accredited microphone calibration services are also available, for both PCB® and competitor models.

Pressure Sensors & Transmitters
Pressure Sensors & Transmitters
PCB® offers a wide variety of pressure sensors to satisfy a multitude of dynamic and static pressure measurement requirements.
Piezoelectric, strain gage, thin film, and piezoresistive sensing technologies are offered. Whether it’s a pharmaceutical injection design
application, an explosives test, or a combustion instability study of a rocket motor, we can helpwith sensors, that are off-the-shelf or custom
designed for the specific application.
Differences between static & dynamic pressure sensors.
Static pressure sensors most often use strain gage, piezoresistive, or capacitive sensing technologies. Such devices are capable
of measuring slowly changing or static pressures and are ideal for many process monitoring requirements. Although some
specialty silicon based sensors can achieve higher frequencies and faster rise times, most static pressure sensors have a
response limited to about 1000 Hz and a respective 1 msec rise time. Potentially damaging pressure changes that occur faster
than this can be missed by these sensors.
Dynamic pressure sensors are characterized by their ability to respond withinmicroseconds and achieve frequencies well beyond
100k Hz. They most often use piezoelectric quartz sensing technology, however, other piezoelectric crystals may be used
depending upon the application. Since piezoelectric sensors are AC coupled devices, they do not measure
static pressure. This property provides these sensors with the unique ability to monitor low level dynamic pressures
while being subjected to a high static background pressure level. Piezoelectric pressure sensors have no moving parts, are
rigid, linear, durable, and extremely repeatable. They can withstand high static loads, yet accurately respond to small
pressure fluctuations.

PCB® offers a vast selection of quartz piezoelectric and strain gage sensors for dynamic force, dynamic strain, and static load measurement
requirements. The variety of available configurations supports a multitude of installation options. Whether it’s a mechanical component
durability test, assembly force control requirement, or an end-of-line quality check, we can helpwith sensors that are off-the-shelf or custom
designed for the specific application.
Features & benefits of piezoelectric & strain gage force sensors.
Piezoelectric force sensors are well suited for measuring dynamic and quasi-static force. They feature high stiffness, fast
response, and repeatable performance, permitting them to capture high frequencies and follow fast transient events such as
impacts. The high stiffness allows them to survive repetitive cycles without fatigue. Quasi-static applications may include slow
acting press or mechanical linkage forces acting in a cyclic manner during a production process.
Strain gage force sensors, or load cells, are well suited for measuring slowly changing or static force. They possess DC response
and are appropriate for static applications. Fatigue rated versions are constructed of high-grade steel for surviving many
repetitive cycles encountered during product durability testing. Strain gage load cells are not suitable for capturing frequencies
in excess of several hundred Hz. They are also typically larger than similarly ranged piezoelectric force sensors.

Torque Sensors
PCB® offers an extensive range of strain-gage torque sensors for test, measurement, monitoring, and research & development applications.
Both rotary torque and reaction torque measurements are accommodated with a variety of sensor configurations. Whether it’s an
automotive dynamometer test or a hydraulic pump end-of-line quality assurance check, we can help, with sensors standard or custom
designed for your specific application.
Features & benefits of rotary transformer & digital telemetry signal transmission.
A primary challenge for rotary torque sensors is transferring the measurement signal from the rotating portion to the stationary
portion of the sensor. Two techniques are used by PCB® for rotary torque sensor signal transmission – rotary transformer and
digital telemetry. The rotary transformer is a non-contacting technique providing low maintenance and quiet operation. Digital
telemetry offers noise-free operation. For installations where space is a premium, the TORKDISC ®, with digital telemetry,
provides a shorter coupled installation.
