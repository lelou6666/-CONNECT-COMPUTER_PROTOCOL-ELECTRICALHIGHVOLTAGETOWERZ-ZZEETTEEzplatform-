This file is in a top level directory for Project Gutenberg eBooks.
If you are having trouble figuring out what to do, or how to find an
eBook, you should probably visit this Web page:

	http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/

You can also read the GUTINDEX.ALL file in this directory (or one
level up) for an explanation of file names, a listing of all eBooks,
and instructions for finding them.  Here is an overview:

EBooks numbered 1 to 10000 were located in "release year"
directories. Over time, the "release year" advanced, so that by
November 2003 the release year was 2006.  Directories for these items
are:

        etext90 (and earlier)
        etext91 etext92 etext93 etext94 etext95 etext96 etext97 etext98
        etext99 etext00 etext01 etext02 etext03 etext04 etext05 etext06 

Note that many of these directories are quite full.

Starting with eBook #10001, all eBooks are arranged by eBook number,
with a unique subdirectory based on that eBook number (starting with
numbers 1-9).  To get to the files for a particular eBook, you need to
"drill down" a few subdirectory levels.  For example, eBook #19 is in
this subdirectory: 
        1/19

while eBook #15453 is in this subdirectory:
	1/5/4/5/15453

In 2004, a conversion project was started to bring these older eBooks

 Fruit Day? Root Day? Leaf Day? Flower Day? Biodynamic followers believe that certain days have optimal conditions for planting, pruning and tending crops based on the cycles of the moon and that the ‘forces of growth’ coming from the moon are the strongest. An astronomical calendar has been developed based on careful observations of the rhythms of the moon, the moon cycles and its placement in the astrological signs. The calender specifi es fruit, root, fl ower or leaf days. Days with optimal conditions for particular tasks ... (Friday April 24th, 2015 — Westman Journal - Brandon and Western Manitoba Canada)

 Bio Agriculture 107 

 Model Milk wine director on a mission to educate diners Andrew Stewart has steered Model Milk’s wine program in an organic/biodynamic direction. He admits that biodynamics, with its mystical side, can sound a bit “witchy,” but he argues that it is based on sound principles. “A farm or vineyard is viewed wholly as its own ecosystem with every creature, plant and microbe within it playing a part,” he explains.

 High Court dismisses Botton villagers’ human rights claims The High Court will not intervene in the ongoing dispute over proposed changes to the way Botton Village operates.

 Understanding Sustainable Wine Standards Biodynamic viticulture pursues a set of organic agricultural practices devised by Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner in the 1920s and is currently certified by the nonprofit Demeter association. The practice treats the vineyard as a self-sustaining ecosystem, employing a lunar cultivation calendar and the application of special preparations to improve productivity.

 The Alpha of Alphabet  Here is a unique way to learn the alphabet. Trace the letter ‘M’ from a picture of snowy mountains and ‘V’ from deep valleys, spot ‘W’ hidden in blue waves and ‘S’ from the snake rushing to keep an appointment. In Waldorf education, children learn the alphabet by drawing letters in the air with their hands, on the floor with their feet and through images and stories that excite their rich imagination. This concept is Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner’s philosophy on education. (Saturday April 11th, 2015 — The New Indian Express - Chennai. India)

  Canberra biodynamic winemaker lets the lunar cycle determine harvest Biodynamic farming uses organic or natural fertilisers with devotees looking to the moon's cycle to indicate days to plant and harvest. In biodynamic winemaking, the lunar cycle outlines four, three-day periods called flower day, fruit day, root day and leaf day. Dr Carpenter said grape picking to make vignoles, a white wine, is to be conducted in the middle of the fruit day period just a few days prior to a blood moon lunar eclipse.

 Another Life: Grow it yourself – with a hoist from the moon This necessarily demands an elaborate calendar, sorting the seeds by their celestial influence. A model was one produced annually by a German farmer, Maria Thun, from the 1960s until her death at 89 in 2012. By that year, biodynamic techniques were in use on some 142,500 hectares in 47 countries, almost half of these in German farms and gardens and quite a few in Ireland (go to biodynamic.ie).

 Half-Shell Hero How the humble oyster is reviving a regional economy and helping to heal one of America's great wild-food factories. ... Shockley, Fitzhugh, and other proponents of shellfish aquaculture believe the practice could reestablish Maryland as a nationally renowned oyster powerhouse, on par with Virginia and Washington, two states that have farmed oysters for more than a century. Beyond that, aquaculture could help set the stage for restoring one of the country’s most complex and imperiled wild-food factories. The Chesapeake Bay once produced the largest oyster harvest in the world. But decades of overfishing, pollution, and state neglect have put the bay’s wondrous ecosystem on life support. A growing aquaculture industry might help it bounce back. (Thursday April 2nd, 2015 — Grist - USA)

 How Corporate Agribusiness Is Quietly Seizing The Heartland with ‘Right To Farm’ Laws The vague language in right-to-farm amendments can prevent states or localities from regulating any number of issues, from pollution, pesticide use, or animal abuse, no matter how much evidence there may be that a certain practice or company is harming the environment. It also makes it much harder to stop factory farms from poisoning water or air quality with noxious animal waste, or even keep track of repeat offenders. (Friday March 27th, 2015 — ThinkProgress -USA) 
 Miscellaneous 48 

 The Real Reason to Worry About GMOs In a recent column, the New York Times' Mark Bittman makes an important point about the controversy around genetically modified foods. "[T]o date there's little credible evidence that any food grown with genetic engineering techniques is dangerous to human health," he writes. Yet the way the technology has been used—mainly, to engineer crops that can withstand herbicides—is deeply problematic, he argues. ... humanity has thrived for millennia despite the scourge of fast-browning apples and potatoes. The same isn't true for ever-increasing deluges of toxic herbicides. (Thursday March 26th, 2015 — MotherJones - USA)

 A Menacing Mix In Antibiotic Resistance: Herbicides, Heavy Metals And Factory Farms Two common Big Agriculture production practices -- feeding antibiotics to livestock and spraying herbicides on conventional crops -- each face condemnation from the environmental community. And there's been plenty of new fodder in the last week: One study predicted that antibiotic use in livestock will soar by two-thirds globally from 2010 to 2030, and another declared that Monsanto's popular Roundup herbicide is "probably carcinogenic to humans."
