About this item



Symantec Storage Foundation powered by Veritas delivers storage Quality of Service (QoS) at the application level and maximizes your storage efficiency, availability and performance across operating systems, virtualization technologies, and storage hardware. Storage Foundation enables a flexible and agile infrastructure with features such as SmartIO and Flexible Storage Sharing while reducing storage costs with features such as deduplication, compression, thin provisioning, and storage tiering. Storage Foundation also provides a standard set of integrated tools from Veritas Operations Manager, a comprehensive management platform. With Storage Foundation, you can adopt Solid State Drive (SSD) technology and implement any changes to your storage infrastructure, including operating system or array migrations, without impacting application availability.

SYMANTEC BUYING PROGRAMS: EXPRESS

Symantec Buying Programs are designed to streamline the purchase of Symantec security and availability software as well as support and maintenance services. Aligned to a variety of business requirements, Symantec Buying Programs offer enterprise customers the ability to earn greater discounts and to effectively track and manage software licenses.

The Symantec Express program is designed especially for small to mid-sized companies that need an easy way to purchase small license quantities for use within a single country - without the time-consuming negotiations and complexity of signing contracts.

Small and mid-sized business customers can use this program to purchase all Symantec security and availability software products, as well as support and maintenance service options. Ordering additional licenses on a given transaction can qualify the purchase for a different pricing band, making the customer eligible for greater incentives.

Los Angeles Public Library's Central Library is a depository site for government information published by:
•U.S. Government Printing Office
•U.S. Patent & Trademark Office
•United Nations
•State of California

The Library also provides access to selected publications of:
•City of Los Angeles
•County of Los Angeles

These publications are received in a variety of formats including electronic, print, and microfiche. Many government documents can be found in the LAPL Catalog and are searchable by author, title, or keyword. Once located in the catalog, the subject department where the actual document can be viewed is indicated. You'll find that most government documents can be found in the following subject departments: Business & Economics; Social Science, Philosophy & Religion; Science, Technology & Patents; and History & Genealogy.

Additionally, selected documents are available from LAPL Databases and the LAPL Web Pages lists. Databases are available at LAPL’s Central Library and Branches, and in some cases from personal computers with an LAPL library card.  Web Pages are available from any computer with Internet access.

The Federal government is dedicated to moving its publications to electronic format.  As a result, many documents are available on the Internet. Use the gateways to locate your information.
