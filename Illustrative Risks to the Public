This list summarizes items that have appeared in the Internet Risks Forum Digest (RISKS) - which I moderate (comp.risks newsgroup) - and/or published ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes (SEN). In this collection of mostly one-liner summaries, (R i j) denotes RISKS volume i issue j; (S vol no:page) denotes an issue of SEN, where there has been one volume per year, with vol 33 being the year 2008; page numbers are given fairly regularly from 1993 on; (SAC vol no) indicates an item in the quarterly SIGSAC Security and Control Review, where vol 16 is 1998, which was the final volume. The RISKS-relevant SEN material prior to 1995 is summarized in my Computer-Related Risks book (see below). SEN material is now being brought on-line by Will Tracz: http://www.acm.org/sigsoft 

Some incidents are well documented, while others need further study. A few are of questionable authenticity, and are noted as such ("bogus???"). Please send me corrections and new cases, along with suitable references. This document is updated at least quarterly and is browsable on-line (ftp://ftp.CSL.sri.com/neumann/illustrative.html courtesy of Otfried Cheong's Hyperlatex). [Hyperlatex is wonderful Free Software:

Send contributions to risks@CSL.sri.com. Archives are available at http://www.risks.org, which redirects to Lindsay Marshall's Web site at Newcastle http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/, including a nice search facility. Specific issues can be read directly as http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/I.J.html [where I=volume#, J=issue#]. SRI's archive is at ftp://ftp.sri.com/risks or by "ftp ftp.sri.com", "login anonymous", "cd risks" (which gets the "dir" for the current volume, and "cd i" then gets you into the subdirectory for noncurrent volume i). An Australian mirror is at http://the.wiretapped.net/security/textfiles/risks-digest/. "Inside Risks" distills some of the discussion into a monthly inside-back-cover column in the Communications of the ACM. The list of columns to date is given at the end of this document. 

My book (Peter G. Neumann, Computer-Related Risks, Addison-Wesley (ISBN 0-201-55805-X) and ACM Press (ACM Order 704943), 1995) summarizes many of these cases and provides additional analysis. (A few errata for the first three printings are on my Web page, noted above.) Most of the (S vol no) items listed below for no < 20 are discussed in the book; more recent items generally include the relevant on-line (R i j) references. If you cannot find the book in a bookstore, it is on amazon.com, or call A-W within the U.S. at 1-800-822-6339 - or if you are outside of the U.S., 1-617-944-3770 and ask for International Orders. The book is now also available in Japanese (ISBN 4-89471-141-9). Instead of trying to produce a second edition in the face of a massive influx of new RISKS cases, the fourth and fifth printings of the book gives the URL for the Addison-Wesley Web site (http:www.awl.com/cseng/titles/ISBN-0-201-55805-X/), which includes the first chapter of the book and an extended preface. That Web site and my own contain further material that would otherwise have gone into the second edition. 

Henry Petroski (among others) has noted that we rarely learn from our successes, and must learn more from our failures. The collection of cases cited here provides rich opportunities for reflection that could help us to avoid similar problems in the future. Unfortunately, it also demonstrates that the same types of mistakes tend to recur, over and over... 

SEN and RISKS also consider approaches for developing better computer systems, e.g., safer, more reliable, more secure, fewer cost and schedule overruns, etc. There are many approaches to developing sound systems; none is guaranteed. Whereas the emphasis in the following list is on problems rather than on would-be solutions, the pervasive nature of the problems suggests that techniques for the effective development and operation of computer-related systems are frequently ignored. Worse yet, even ideal systems can result in serious risks, through unanticipated technological problems or human foibles. We include here primarily cases that have been publically reported, although we know of various additional cases whose existence for one reason or another has not seen the light of day. A few successes are also included, although the failures seem to predominate. We are always interested in hearing more about successes. Although I receive occasional complaints about the preponderance of failures in RISKS, there appear to be very few real successes. Perhaps not enough folks are heeding some of the advice that you can gather from RISKS and that are distilled in Computer-Related Risks. 

Descriptor Symbols
 The following descriptor symbols characterize each entry. 
! = Loss of life/lives; * = Potentially life-critical or safety problem 

V = Overall system or subsystem surViVability problems (with respect to diVerse adVersities, including attacks and malfunctions). Startlingly many cases fit this category; many V-unflagged cases also represent failures to continue performing properly, or delays, or other cases of misuse that could have led to much more serious survivability problems. 

$ = Loss of resources, primarily financial 

S = Security/integrity/misuse problem; P = Privacy/rights abuse or concern 

H = Intentional Human misuse (e.g., user-administrator-operator-penetrator) 

h = Accidental Human misuse or other inadvertence 

a = Event attributed to animal(s) 

I = Insider; O = Outsider; A = Inadequate Authentication, Access control, or Accountability 

d = System Development problems 

e = Improper Evolution/maintenance/upgrade. (H,h,i,f,d,e involve human foibles.) 

r = Problems with Requirements for system or operation (including the overall system concept) 

f = Flaws (or Features in design, or hardware/software implementation) 

i = MisInterpretation/confusion/human errors at a man-system Interface; documentation problems 

m = Hardware Malfunction attributable to system deficiencies, the physical environment, acts of God, etc. 

M = Malfunction or misuse specifically due to electronic or other interference 

+ = Beneficial; - = problematic with none of the above categories 

@ = This item is also listed in another category

1.22 Election Problems

We have reported election problems in Software Engineering Notes and RISKS for many years. Many of these problems are summarized below. More recently, in the 2000 election, particularly in Florida, the chickens of neglect have come home to roost, exemplifying everything we have been saying all these many years - and more. Similar to the 1988 fiasco where a 210,000-ballot undervote occurred in the Senate Race in four counties run by BCR/Cronus, 19,000 votes were disqualified for the presidential race in Palm Beach County, and many more in Broward County - perhaps because of the confusion raised by the butterfly ballots. There are also some reports of the left-hand and right-hand pages being improperly aligned, so that a vote for one candidate actually counted for another candidate. Dimpled chad became important - perhaps resulting in part from blocked and never-cleaned chad trays (and there was a lot of extra chad resulting the invalidated multiple votes!). There were many irregularities involving improper voter disenfranchisement, with at least 91,000 voters being unable to vote because of a largely erroneous list of supposed convicted felons - including one election commissioner who found herself incorrectly on the list, and was apparently the only one to block use of the list in her region. 

Also, see the CACM Inside Risks articles from November 1990 (PGN), 1992, 1993, 2000 (Rebecca Mercuri), January 2002 (Mercuri), as well as November 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007 (various authors). (http://www.csl.sri.com/neumann/insiderisks.html). 

Numerous problems are noted in the on-line RISKS, along with various commentaries (R 21 10-14). We note that punched-card systems are inherently flaky (!), and that even optical scanning is problematic, but that direct-recording electronic systems tend to be subject to serious potentials for fraud and manipulation. Internet voting is a disaster waiting to happen in light of the inadequate security of the Internet, personal computer systems, and subvertible servers. For example, the SERVE system appears to be seriously flawed. Proposals to vote from automated teller machines (R 21 15-16) are also problematic, and basically undesirable. Election 2000 demonstrated once again that we need to reexamine the entire election process objectively, and devise less-easily subvertible checks and balances that can provide much greater assurance. Election 2002 still had vastly too many problems, many of which have not been eliminated for Election 2004. 

Integrity throughout the election process is essential. And yet we repeatedly hear about unexplained anomalies (enumerated below, including the 1985 articles by David Burnham noted below) and various suspicions of fraud - some with convictions. For example, Ransom Shoup II (purveyor of the ShoupTronic election machines) was convicted of two felony counts - election fraud and conspiracy to commit election fraud. In 1996, Senator Chuck Hagel was CEO of the election company (now a part of ES&S) used by most of Nebraska in his first-term election (e.g., see Thom Hartmann, If you want to win an election, just control the voting machines, The Hill, 31 Jan 2003 - R 22 55); this may not have affected the outcome, but the early denial of the association is certainly ethically curious. In 1999, 22 people were indicted in Louisiana and 9 admitted guilt in a huge bribery/kickback election scam involving the acquisition of Sequoia voting systems. 

Numerous Web sites are springing up with timely information in addition to mine and Rebecca's. For example, see David Dill's Voter Verification Newsletter and subscribe: www.VerifiedVoting.org Also, see Lynn Landes's Web site www.ecotalk.org/VotingSecurity.htm and particularly www.ecotalk.org/VotingMachineErrors.htm for considerable detail on election fraud and irregularities. Another useful site is http://www.epic.org/privacy/voting/. 

If you are seriously interested in what might be needed for a high-integrity election process, and a further study of the inherent risks, see the outstanding University of Pennsylvania PhD thesis http://www.notablesoftware.com/evote.html of Rebecca Mercuri (mercuri@acm.org), Electronic Vote Tabulation Checks and Balances, 2000. What we are calling the Mercuri Method involves voter-verified paper ballot-images that become part of the official records. Useful URLs for various other relevant organizations are included at the end of that Web site. See also "Explanation of Voter-Verified Ballot Systems" (Rebecca Mercuri, S 27 5:15-16, R 22 17). See also my later comments (S 28 2:16-17) based on R 22 36 and R 22 38.

He is still active.] See "Accuracy, Integrity, and Security in Computerized Vote-Tallying, Roy G.

..... U.S. election events, 1984 and before: 

1982: Elkhart, Indiana, program failed in midstream, programmer rebooted or patched the system on the fly during the election process. (S 10 3:8); more in (S 10 4) 

SH 1984: Series of articles by David Burnham in The New York Times, (29Jul, 30Jul, 4Aug, 21Aug, 23Sep, 24Sep, 18Dec 1985) documents vulnerabilities to tampering in Computer Election Systems (then the dominant electronic vendor); elections with their machines challenged in Indiana, WVirginia, and Maryland, with rigging suspected in the 1984 election in the first two states; Federal Election Commission standards inadequate; Texas also investigated numerous discrepancies, involving Business Records Corporation (which subsequently was involved in the Florida fiasco of 1988) - formerly known as Computer Election Systems; NSA asked to investigate if CES systems were open to fraud; California and Florida also investigated; Michael Shamos quoted - CES systems equipment "is a security nightmare open to tampering in a multitude of ways." The Burnham articles are a startling warning shot that was almost completely ignored. [Most lawsuits later thrown out: not guilty or lack of evidence, particularly in the absence of audit trails!]. 

1984: McCloskey McIntyre Congresional election in Illinois long questioned, with only a few votes making the difference depending on which were thrown out in which recount. Other problems in Dade County in 1984, West Virginia, St. Louis (S 10 3:8)

Many other problems include weak standards and secret system evalutions, partisan oversight, inadequate funding for NIST and Election Assistance Commission, poor training, dirty tricks (S 30 1, elaborating on R 23 58,59); Better standards needed for elections (R 23 59; S 30 1; more in R 23 61)

This report considers the technical implications, risks, and costs of `key recovery', `key escrow', and `trusted third-party' encryption systems.

This report was reissued in the summer of 1998 with a new preface: "One year after the 1997 publication of the first edition of this report, its essential finding remains unchanged and unchallenged: The deployment of key recovery systems designed to facilitate surreptitious government access to encrypted data and communications introduces substantial risks and costs. These risks and costs may not be appropriate for many applications of encryption, and they must be more fully addressed as governments consider policies that would encourage ubiquitous key recovery."

1.34 Calendar/Date/Clock Problems including Y2K

..... Y2K Manifestations: approaching 1/1/00 

$rfed Many of the following Y2K problems are the result of decades of collossal short-sightedness, in requirements specification in the first place, as well as throughout the development process. Note that in 1965 the Multics development effort recognized the 35-year-away Y2K problem and addressed it quite constructively, using a 71-bit date-time field lasting long after Y2K. The costs are staggering. The lessons that should be learned from this experience are profound. It is not just the Y2K remediation that is relevant - it is the entire software development process. [I have not even bothered to insert the new "r" descriptor in those cases below in which faulty requirements are obviously implicated!] 

f Discussion of date and century roll-over problems: Fujitsu SRS-1050 ISDN display phones fail on two-digit month (10); 1401 one-character year field; COBOL improvements; IBM 360 (S 20 2:13)

2.3 Pun-intended definitions

The San Jose Mercury (4 Jan 2004) gave a list of the 50 best punny definitions of the year (R 23 14). Here are several with computer technology relevance: 

·  off-shorn: vt. Getting cut because your job moved overseas. [RICHTER SCALEr, San Jose]
·  Microsofa: n. A piece of furniture that, while it looked fine in the showroom, gradually begins to dominate the living room, eventually forcing you to replace all the other furniture, including the TV, to be "compatible". [Earl T. Cohen, Fremont]
·  motherbored: n. In many homes, a technology discussion at dinner between father and the kids. (Bruce Kerr)
·  Luddate: n. Someone you are going out with who does not understand the [Santa Clara] Valley's obsession with technology. (Lisa Lawrence, Palo Alto)
·  Crisco: n. A person who got fried by buying Cisco at $80 a share. (finally, here is an unfortunate motto for the ages: If it is not now on the Web, it does not exist; what's more, it never existed. (Too bad. A lot of good old stuff gets lost and becomes totally ignored if it is not on-line. At least this file is accessible. And now, even the early SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes items are as well, thanks to Will Tracz.)
