New Site for Softrock Kits' Documentation - WB5RVZ.ORG 

I have permanently moved several of the kit projects over to a new site with different technologies. Kits' documentation that is moved will no longer be maintained on this legacy site. Links in the menu above have been modified to direct you to the new site for any kits so moved.

The kits moved so far are: 
1.Combined SR Lite II RX
2.Ensemble RX II (HF/LF) 
3.Softrock-40-R (NEW)
4.Ensemble RXTX

Welcome to WB5RVZ.COM

Welcome to my website. I have built this site to allow me to provide to hams worldwide the resuts of my labor of love, the documentation - in a Heathkit style - of the construction of the several "Softrock" Software-defined Radio (SDR) kits designed and distributed by my friend, Tony Parks.
 
Current Softrock Kits' Availability

Many have discovered Softrocks from browsing on the web and have asked about how to get a Softrock kit. The biggest problem with getting the kits is timing your access to the ordering website. The designer and kit-maker is Tony Parks, KB9YIG. He is a retired engineer who does this for the love of the hobby (and might make a buck or two of pin money but certainly no living from the sale of the kits). Because he is not a real business, nor is he rich, he does not have the capital to finance a large inventory of unsold kits. He makes kits available as he can source the boards, crystals, ICs, and other components, in small batches. He usually makes an announcement on the Softrock40 reflector a couple days before he makes the kits available on his website.

Consequently, most of the time his website will show no quantities available. When kits do come up available, they are usually sold out within 24-48 hours and then we all wait for the next batch to be kitted up.

If you want to order a kit, you should:
1.Sign up on the  Yahoo Softrock40 reflector and request the "individual email" rather than the daily digest for your message delivery option. That way, you will get (more than you want) postings as soon as they are made. 
2.If you don't already have one, get yourself a PayPal account (Tony can only take PayPal). 
3.Keep checking the  Softrock ordering website. (Some folks have even gotten one of those programs that automatically check out a webpage for any changes and alert you when they occur). Most often, you will see "check back soon" on the page alongside the object of your desire! When kits become available, the "check back soon" changes to an order quantity dropdown box. 

What is SDR?

There are many definitions for Software Defined Radio. The essence of each definition is that some or all of the traditional functionality of a radio is handled in software on a computer, rather than in circuitry in a traditional radio. Note that SDR is not control of a radio using software; it is, rather, implementation of a radio in software. If you have never seen or experienced SDR in action, take a look at this Flash video by AC8GY from his informative  SDR website.  

SDR Theory and Information

John, W4JKL, has provided this list of valueable resources for those interested in diving deeper into the theory behind SDR. These reference, plus the "Theory of Operation" sections in each of the kits documented here on the WB5RVZ site, should take the reader a long way toward appreciating this truly fascinating aspect of our shared hobby.


•Go here for the original SoftRock-40 "SDR sampler project". This page (the kit was long ago "retired") has an excellent and east to follow exposition of the basic architecture that is applied in the kits documented on the WB5RVZ site. 

 Tony has ressurected this kit as a (nearly) all-smt-SDR-on-a-dongle kit, to called the Softrock-40-R!  
•Go here for "A Software defined Radio for the Masses" QEX articles: which is the intellectual basis for Gerald Youngblood, K5SDR's, FlexRadio products.
•Go here for an introduction to the all-important mathematical foundation for SDR as an applicationm of Digital Signal Processing (DSP): 
•Go here for Doug Smith's seminal tutorial on DSP (4 part series in QEX magazine)
•Go here for the latest table of contents of the Softrock40 Yahoo Group (reflector: you must join to see) files
•Go here for Rick Lyons' article on Quadrature concepts and complex numbers  Quadrature Signals: Complex, but not Complicated (thanks to Andrea Montefusco, IW0HDV, for suggesting this for inclusion in the list)
•Tim, N9RO, has some interesting facts concerning his usage of SDR. You can read a little bit more about how Tim uses software defined radios by checking out N9RO.com

The "Software" Component of "Software Defined Radio"

While these pages and kits concentrate on the hardware part of the SDR mix, there are some software essentials you will need to chase down if you are building one of the Softrock SDR kits.

In order to test (and later, operate, your rig, you must download and install required software (SDR programs and Dynamic Link Libraries, along with hardware drivers. The actual steps and programs may vary, depending upon your computer's windows operating system version (XP, Vista, or Windows 7) and architecture CPU/memory (32 bit or 64 bit).

*Note on installing PE0-FKO's USB Drivers: First extract the .zip file to a temporary directory (on the Desktop), plug in the device and it will show "Found new hardware DG8SAQ-I2C". Direct the wizard to the folder to whichthe software was extracted (you should see a "PE0FKO.inf" file in the folder) and the software will be installed.

Install Driver

The correct procedure is to download the driver and put it in a suitable folder, then plug in the USB lead, Windows should detect new hardware has been found and you need to manually point it to the folder containing the drive. It should then install correctly. Certainly does on Win2000 and XP. On Vista or Windows 7, there might be some issues with driver signing. There have been messages on the forum describing methods of working around these issues. One such solution is addressed in  the author's MOBO4.3 builders notes.

Install/Run CFGSR ("ConFiGureSoftRock")

Once the driver is installed, if you run 'CFGSR' that will either automatically 'open' the firmware, or if not, you need to go to the 'USB' tab and select it from the list displayed in the bottom box. Which way depends on if you have 'CFGSR' set up to auto connect on program start or not.

Test Local Oscillator in Si570-Based Kits

You can use 'CFGSR' to exercise the Si570 using the 'Tune' tab that makes it into a 'VFO'. Just a case of setting the frequency, and the Si570 should output a signal at 4 times the frequency displayed on the main display on the screen. The 'Test' tab can also be used to look at all the various Si570 registers etc, but probably unnecessary as if you can hear or measure the Si570 output frequency, you know it is working.

How to Hack a Radio to Pick Up Different Frequencies - Including Law Enforcement & More

Hardware hacks are something I feel we don't get enough of at Null Byte, so today I figured I would introduce a fun one. I've always been a curious hardware hacker. Taking things apart and learning how their internals work has always been a part of my nature. Quite some years ago, my father showed me a really cool trick on how to hack normal radios to scan frequencies that are normally non-listenable. This little hack allowed us to scan frequencies belonging to law enforcement, and even frequencies that the town fair had used to make announcements over a loudspeaker.

To have fun with this cool hack, we're going to need a few things.

Note: I'm not sure if this works on all radios. I haven't tried it on anything other than 3 cheap radios from Wal-Mart. I would imagine that all radios work the same, so in theory, this should be possible with any radio.

Requirements
•A cheap, disposable radio
•A Philips-head screwdriver

Step 1 Pop Open the Radio

First, let's take apart the radio so that we can get to its internals. You need to remove all of the screws necessary to get the case completely separated. Depending on the radio model, this may mean that you need to remove all of the screws.

Step 2 Hack the Tuner

Radios change which station they're listening to by adjusting a small, copper-looking wire coiled around a cylinder. When adjusted, the gaps between the coils in the copper wire become tighter or more separated depending on how the tuner knob is adjusted.

In order to hack your radio, here's what you need to do:
1.Turn the tuning knob on the outside of the radio.
2.Observe the mechanism connected to the tuning knob on the inside of the radio, while continuing to turn the knob. This will lead to your wire and cylinder that controls what frequency the radio is scanning.
3.Turn the radio on. If it doesn't turn on, make sure everything is connected properly.
4.Turn the volume up.
5.Pull and separate the wire that is on the cylinder. You should hear the static shift and warp, this means you are changing stations. Adjust the coil until you start hearing human-related sounds from the speakers.
6.Congratulations! You are listening to a broadcast that isn't supposed to be a broadcast.

Not sure which century this how-to was written in, but looking at the photo accompanying it I would guess towards the end of WWII. Most new and cheap radio receivers do not use capacitive/inductive resonator circuits you can toy with. Oh and by the way even if you can hack the cheap radio to receive in a higher or lower band, there is nothing interesting to listen to anymore as mobile phones, cordless phones, baby monitors, public safety and commercial broadcasts have either gone digital or are transmitting at microwave frequencies your hacked little radio just cannot get to, even if you hit it with a hammer. So, rather spend your money on a cheap radio scanner (also available at Wal-Mart) with which you can listen to many, many interesting things without having to hack anything.

Yeah, but this was just for fun, just to show people it's possible, nothing more :D. Police scanners are cheap nowadays, and hacking cell phones isn't exactly hard via bluetooth. A friend I have has actually inspired me to attempt to write a Linux driver for a PCIe, large spectrum radio antennae. Imagine the fun that could happen with that? Haha. Got a bit more ASM before I'm ready for that, though...

Sorry did not mean to sound critical. From your comment I deduct you want to sample (A/D) RF directly into your computer so you can do the demodulation and filtering digitally. In the world of DIY radio, Software Defined Radio (SDR for short) is all the rage these days. You can buy them commercially, in kit form or build e'm from scratch. For less than a cheap wall-mart radio you can buy a Softrock SDR kit and get into the game (http://www.wb5rvz.com/)

WildVoice Studio is freeware for recording Podcasts and radio programs.  Screenshot by Corey Deitz © WildVoice 
  

Software empowers people and helps make Podcasts easier to do and better sounding. Like any other kind of software, the more you work with it, the better you become. Most of the software listed here is free. Try to work with it all to see what you like best.

Recording Software

A podcast can be just your voice. Many Podcasters default to a simple presentation either because they choose an easy method or know the information they are providing does not need enhancement.

But, you may want to use a pre-recorded show intro, with various inserted pieces of audio, possibly commercials, etc.

Many Podcasters use Audacity, a free and open source multi-track recorder which will at minimum allow you to record, edit and mix your voice with music or sound effects. Audacity comes in both Windows and Mac versions and you can download it from the Audacity website.

Another useful program for audio editing is Kristal Audio Engine, a multi-track recorder that is also free. Visit the publisher's site for more information.

Finally, let me suggest you look at Wavosaur, an audio editor which is also free. More information and download is available at wavosaur.com.

Digital Mixing

Although mixing can be done with any multi-track recorder like Audacity, there are some program designed to assist in mixing. One program is WildVoice which allows you to record your voice and mix in music and sound effects while you're talking. You can then edit and "mix" your audio into one final sound file.
