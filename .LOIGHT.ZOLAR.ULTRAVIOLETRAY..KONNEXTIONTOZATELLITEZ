 Some thoughts:

 It takes bravery to do this thing of acting outside of accepted norms. Which is a valiant choice.

 As a member of The Tribe, you will be judged and sometimes harshly. Using the power of choice is how you arrived at the doorsteps of this group. You saw one of my YouTube videos, or someone said hey you need to join this group, and you made the decision to come here. One of the biggest lies on the planet is your fate is predetermined. Part of this is due to cultural indoctrination deeply rooted in tribalism. There are prescribed measures of what you should do to be considered a successful person.

 I agree with many of those measures my issue stems from the way that you travel to what we consider to be an accomplishment. The box is narrow and tight. Anyone that is operating outside of that box on a regular to moderately radical perspective is considered an undesirable variable of society.If you are operating outside the box and achieve a high level of success because of it, you’re lauded as a trailblazer and progressive thinker. Without the evidence of massive success, you’re considered a kook or weird person. Frequently when you're walking on a different path you will yield different outcomes and results than someone walking a pedestrian road.

 Many things that you will learn here will be radical. 

 However, they will be in your best interest and properly applied will make your life better. Put more money in your pocket and help you achieve your dreams. There are many things to be learned here but more importantly this is a great place to share what you’ve learned and to help others.

Thank you your video helped me. I used my shop vac, now my laptop is no 
 longer over heating and shutting down. The fan is now working perfectly and 
 my cooling system error message went away. ﻿


Labobo (1 месяц назад) 


Is the computer still working? It's been 5 years.

 That is a good way of bending the pin the cooling fan spins around.
 It can also with suction pull on the thin cables whose connector was not 
 designed for that sort of cleaning.

 The overall design of toshiba laptops are bad. The case design allows dust 
 to the motherboard.
 You can even see what looks like small child fingerprints on the inside of 
 the case.﻿


Kendall Browning (5 мес. назад) 


lol, I've been sticking a bag of frozen food under mine so it won't die.﻿


Miaow mix (4 дн. назад) 


I wanna try this but some people said it made it worse﻿


Tallezz joss (21 дн. назад) 


i do it once a week, still doesn't work, even a bag of ice doesn't work :c 
 what now?﻿


David Maxey (5 дн. назад) 


Using vacuums actually creates static electricity charges that can harm 
 microelectronics because of how sensitive they are. Not a bad quick-fix 
 though, i like the paper covering it to create a better suction and a 
 refined point of cleaning.﻿


Micic00 (6 мес. назад) 


Thanks so much. I got chunks of dust coming out of there. I would also 
 suggest that before doing this (or instead of doing this) to use compressed 
 air to blow out the dust because vacuum cleaner doesn't do that, or blow 
 yourself without the compressor from side (where cooler is) - watch out for 
 dust, there is always a lot of it. All of this knocked down my temperatures 
 considerably﻿


Michael Holliness (4 мес. назад) 


I'll Try it out, I was going to disassemble the system but any quick tip is 
 cool. God Bless!﻿


MARK FERGUSON (8 мес. назад) 


Thank you! Do you have any suggestions for creating your own laptop 
 cooler?﻿


Oscar Lopez (5 мес. назад) 


I do have the same problem I going to trie see how it works I let you know 
 what happen thanks ﻿


Joseph White (5 мес. назад) 


Thanks so much sir, I have a toshiba Satellite s855-s5265, I used a vacuum 
 cleaner and I am noticing a huge difference!﻿


Becky Anderson (7 мес. назад) 


Always keep your Toshiba device’s cooling vents as clear as possible. This 
 helps the system to draw air more effectively, so that it can stay cooler, 
 reduce dust build-up inside and and run far more efficiently at all times.

Ismael Abufon (9 мес. назад) 


My dad did something like this once testing a new vacuum cleaner... and the 
 laptop never turned on again. Don't do this. Just take it to someone who 
 can open it and clean it thoroughly....

 Anyway, I just cleaned a C600 and it still turns off when watching full 
 screen video.﻿


Star Knight (10 мес. назад) 


Thank you for sharing this. It helped me alot.﻿


Craigslist Hunter (5 мес. назад) 


Cool vid keep it up.﻿


Luis E. Suarez (3 мес. назад) 


Under some circumstances like under very dry weather this procedure may 
 produce static electricity that may kill some sensible components. It is 
 better to fix it using normal procedures if you know how to do it right. 
 Otherwise ask a technician to fix it for you.﻿


Jerome Donegan (9 мес. назад) 


yooooooooo thanks a lot for this video I just tried it and so far I haven't 
 gotten that over heating error﻿


C Webb (1 год назад) 


Its much easier to just pick up a cheap pc repair kid, look at a few 
 YouTube vids and disassemble your laptop instead of doing this witch will 
 most likely mess things up. If your not completely brain dead, keep track 
 of your screws and where your connection are then you will be fine, you can 
 also replace the fan ( usually are cheap ) and put some new thermal paste 
 on there....A lot safer then this! ﻿

Thank you so much for this video! :) I have a Toshiba Satellite P850 that 
 overheats about 10 minutes into most of my games, and I was a little 
 nervous about opening up my laptop to clean it out that way (I had 
 suspected that dust may be a problem). I'll try this technique now, and 
 hopefully my laptop should run a lot better afterwards!﻿

Hey peeps what's up?! I'm back with another windows emulation tutorial, this time with Windows ME (I know, scary right). Now, keep in mind, that this has no practical to it. It's not going to be fast enough to even enjoy a good game of solitaire, let alone Run Crysis 2 at Ultra High Settings. However, it still shows the power of the SDL library combined with android.
