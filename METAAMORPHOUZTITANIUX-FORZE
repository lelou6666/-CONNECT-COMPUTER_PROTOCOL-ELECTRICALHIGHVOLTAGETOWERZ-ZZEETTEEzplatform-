PS1 Swap Trick
 Anonymous  Sat 02 May 2015 20:14:59  No.2380381  ViewReplyOriginalReport  
Quoted By: >>2381856 >>2382030 

What am i doing wrong? I keep trying and failing. 

 I'm using a relatively high TOC count game (THPS2) and everytime i do the last swap the screen either stays black or i get some kind of weird glitched screen.

 Is there any guide that goes more in depth about how to do it?

I don't know if this only works on launch models but it's literally a matter of putting in an audio CD, going to the play menu (but not to the point where it plays it), wait for the CD to stop, and swapping it out for a CD-R. That's it. There's no goofy "swap it out in the half second you get when the PSX game loads" or whatever the fuck everyone's always talked about.

Or, you know, get a Gold Finger like everyone else.

I remember you have to put a small spring (which my Chinese game shark knock off came with) or a piece of wadded paper to keep the lid sensor down. I just paid attention to the disc speed. After doing it a hundred times you get used to it.

I dunno which GameShark versions let you boot backup.

I use psxloader.elf for booting PS1 games on the PS2 -- it's a swap trick, but it'll stop the motor for you (so, no wear/tear, no timing involved).
boot it with freemcboot/Swap Magic's ELF loader and a USB stick

issues:
>still counts as a swap trick, so redbook audio is fucked (games that don't need the disc TOC to find their music are just fine)
>you'll either need a flip lid or to disable the lid-open sensors
>it needs a later model PS2 to work
>you need a DualShock to use the loader, you can plug a different controller in after that's done

oh, and if you don't want to buy Swap Magic, you'll need to do the normal swap trick to boot the Free McBoot installer so you can load psxloader

retro game burns
 Anonymous  Sun 03 May 2015 17:10:28  No.2381927  ViewReplyOriginalReport  
Quoted By: >>2381945 

As retro hunters we all know the risks involved with retro games but we rarely talk about times where we got burned and I know we all have.
 I've had a few bad carts that usually need a little work to get going but I recently picked up Wild Arms 2 and I can't pass any of the first boss battles as the battle starts and no boss shows up leading to the music just continuing with no action.
 Disc has a pretty severe scratch near the middle but no cleaning, changing of systems or different paths have helped me solve the issue. So I'm just chalking it up to the burn pile and a loss of $3.
 So share your stories of loss

I never pay too much and never buy irresponsible so never really got burned.
However, multiple times I have bought something marked as "mint" from ebay only to get a game with a label that is filled with scratches and/or indents. Usually end up with partial refund.

Not sure if relevant, but when I was a kid, my parents bought me a secondhand copy of Final Fantasy IX. I played through until I think Disc 2, where the disc itself starts with the cutscene where Vivi loses his shit and torches a bunch of stuff. Anyway, the disc was fucked up, so it would always freeze at that cutscene. I left it alone for a while, and I don't recall if we replaced the disc, or cleaned it, or what, but it eventually started working again. So I kept playing the game, only to find out that there was no disc 4. Just two different copies of disc 3. Needless to say I was pissed, because this was after I'd had the game for a few years already. I was a kid, so I never thought to check and make sure that all the discs were correct and in good condition.

Anyway, I eventually ended up picking up the last disc only to give up just before the last boss.

best way IMO is to connect the SCART RGB to a CRT computer monitor (some did actually run 15khz signals, especially some sony trinitrons). For this to work, I had to have "sync-on-green", where you combine the green signal and the VSYNC signal in one line.

>The main difference is scart has sound.

For newbies, the biggest difference they should be aware of is probably how SCART isn't hot-swappable. In fact, it can be quite dangerous to your equipment to unplug an on SCART source.

It's not like your typical HMDI or VGA cable. If your SNES is on, feeding scart, don't unplug that cable until you shut if off.

You can have just rgbs with a scart connector. EU scart that's fully connected and has voltage is different.

I'd worry more about a N64 cartridge being yanked personally.

Removing any plug while it's on is generally a bad idea.

Has no one noticed OP's fantasy system has technology that didn't exist then? The original standard for wi-fi didn't come around till 97, that's why all the early "wireless" controllers were using IR and sucked. So even if you did get your hands on the experimental stuff coming out of CMU, it would have greatly pushed up the price of the console well beyond $449.

Sorry, just seeing "2.4 ghz wireless" and "1994" in the same paragraph tripped my autism.

release: mid '92
name: GigaMind
media: cartridges
hardware: 1.25MB of RAM -- three 256k video pages and one 512k main RAM area
8 channels of sampled audio (can stream samples from the ROM) and a AY-3-8910
audio driver driven by a Z80
video: can display 128 scaled sprites on the screen in hardware, additional graphics (backgrounds, 3D, etc) can be drawn onto the framebuffer directly in software and then overlaid onto the final image
68020 clocked at 12MHz
four controller ports because why not
estimated cost: $250 or $300 initially, would be able to lower that within two years

it's a fairly standard bit of arcade hardware really, other than a bit of framebuffer stuff
the ROMs wouldn't need to be Neo-Geo huge, and I'd need to have quality control so devs didn't just blow huge, ugly sprites onto the screen to save memory

not all beat em ups follow that formula though, if anything it created its own subgenre within beatemups ripping of its features.

Sure, games like Knight of the Round and Tower of Doom are a bit different, but come on nig they are a minority, the number of Final Fight-styled games (for not saying ripoff) are countless, we have Jaleco's Rushing Beat, SNK's failed Burning Fight and Mutation Nation, Sega's Streets of Rage and Riot City, IREM's Undercover Cops and Hook, Bampresto's Denjin Makai games, Konami's Violent Storm, X-Men and Metamorphic Force (after they realized their TMNT/Simpsons engine sucked), Tatsumi's Big Fight, PLUS tons of console games like Maximum Carnage, Sonic Blastman 1/2, Iron Commando. Batman Returns, Pirates of Dark Water, Superman etc.

It's pretty obvious that after Final Fight most beat 'em ups followed a similar formula, seriously, you are trying too hard to be contrarian.

I don't know if this only works on launch models but it's literally a matter of putting in an audio CD, going to the play menu (but not to the point where it plays it), wait for the CD to stop, and swapping it out for a CD-R. That's it. There's no goofy "swap it out in the half second you get when the PSX game loads" or whatever the fuck everyone's always talked about.

Or, you know, get a Gold Finger like everyone else.

I remember you have to put a small spring (which my Chinese game shark knock off came with) or a piece of wadded paper to keep the lid sensor down. I just paid attention to the disc speed. After doing it a hundred times you get used to it.

I dunno which GameShark versions let you boot backup.

I use psxloader.elf for booting PS1 games on the PS2 -- it's a swap trick, but it'll stop the motor for you (so, no wear/tear, no timing involved).
boot it with freemcboot/Swap Magic's ELF loader and a USB stick

issues:
>still counts as a swap trick, so redbook audio is fucked (games that don't need the disc TOC to find their music are just fine)
>you'll either need a flip lid or to disable the lid-open sensors
>it needs a later model PS2 to work
>you need a DualShock to use the loader, you can plug a different controller in after that's done

oh, and if you don't want to buy Swap Magic, you'll need to do the normal swap trick to boot the Free McBoot installer so you can load psxloader

retro game burns

Quoted By: >>2381945 

As retro hunters we all know the risks involved with retro games but we rarely talk about times where we got burned and I know we all have.
 I've had a few bad carts that usually need a little work to get going but I recently picked up Wild Arms 2 and I can't pass any of the first boss battles as the battle starts and no boss shows up leading to the music just continuing with no action.
 Disc has a pretty severe scratch near the middle but no cleaning, changing of systems or different paths have helped me solve the issue. So I'm just chalking it up to the burn pile and a loss of $3.
 So share your stories of loss

I never pay too much and never buy irresponsible so never really got burned.
However, multiple times I have bought something marked as "mint" from ebay only to get a game with a label that is filled with scratches and/or indents. Usually end up with partial refund.

Not sure if relevant, but when I was a kid, my parents bought me a secondhand copy of Final Fantasy IX. I played through until I think Disc 2, where the disc itself starts with the cutscene where Vivi loses his shit and torches a bunch of stuff. Anyway, the disc was fucked up, so it would always freeze at that cutscene. I left it alone for a while, and I don't recall if we replaced the disc, or cleaned it, or what, but it eventually started working again. So I kept playing the game, only to find out that there was no disc 4. Just two different copies of disc 3. Needless to say I was pissed, because this was after I'd had the game for a few years already. I was a kid, so I never thought to check and make sure that all the discs were correct and in good condition.

Anyway, I eventually ended up picking up the last disc only to give up just before the last boss.

best way IMO is to connect the SCART RGB to a CRT computer monitor (some did actually run 15khz signals, especially some sony trinitrons). For this to work, I had to have "sync-on-green", where you combine the green signal and the VSYNC signal in one line.

>The main difference is scart has sound.

For newbies, the biggest difference they should be aware of is probably how SCART isn't hot-swappable. In fact, it can be quite dangerous to your equipment to unplug an on SCART source.

It's not like your typical HMDI or VGA cable. If your SNES is on, feeding scart, don't unplug that cable until you shut if off.

You can have just rgbs with a scart connector. EU scart that's fully connected and has voltage is different.

I'd worry more about a N64 cartridge being yanked personally.

Removing any plug while it's on is generally a bad idea.

Has no one noticed OP's fantasy system has technology that didn't exist then? The original standard for wi-fi didn't come around till 97, that's why all the early "wireless" controllers were using IR and sucked. So even if you did get your hands on the experimental stuff coming out of CMU, it would have greatly pushed up the price of the console well beyond $449.

Sorry, just seeing "2.4 ghz wireless" and "1994" in the same paragraph tripped my autism.

release: mid '92
name: GigaMind
media: cartridges
hardware: 1.25MB of RAM -- three 256k video pages and one 512k main RAM area
8 channels of sampled audio (can stream samples from the ROM) and a AY-3-8910
audio driver driven by a Z80
video: can display 128 scaled sprites on the screen in hardware, additional graphics (backgrounds, 3D, etc) can be drawn onto the framebuffer directly in software and then overlaid onto the final image
68020 clocked at 12MHz
four controller ports because why not
estimated cost: $250 or $300 initially, would be able to lower that within two years

it's a fairly standard bit of arcade hardware really, other than a bit of framebuffer stuff
the ROMs wouldn't need to be Neo-Geo huge, and I'd need to have quality control so devs didn't just blow huge, ugly sprites onto the screen to save memory

Sure, games like Knight of the Round and Tower of Doom are a bit different, but come on nig they are a minority, the number of Final Fight-styled games (for not saying ripoff) are countless, we have Jaleco's Rushing Beat, SNK's failed Burning Fight and Mutation Nation, Sega's Streets of Rage and Riot City, IREM's Undercover Cops and Hook, Bampresto's Denjin Makai games, Konami's Violent Storm, X-Men and Metamorphic Force (after they realized their TMNT/Simpsons engine sucked), Tatsumi's Big Fight, PLUS tons of console games like Maximum Carnage, Sonic Blastman 1/2, Iron Commando. Batman Returns, Pirates of Dark Water, Superman etc.

It's pretty obvious that after Final Fight most beat 'em ups followed a similar formula, seriously, you are trying too hard to be contrarian.
