The aim of the research is to create a sense of “being there” for natural and realistic communication by developing 3D image/sound technology and multisensory interfaces, and also by investigating human perceptual and cognitive mechanisms in order to develop measurement techniques. For 3D image technology, NICT is focused on developing glasses-free 3D display systems such as with electronic holography, a super multi-view display and a handheld box-shaped 3D display based on the integral photography technique. In this paper, the current status of our research is described.
