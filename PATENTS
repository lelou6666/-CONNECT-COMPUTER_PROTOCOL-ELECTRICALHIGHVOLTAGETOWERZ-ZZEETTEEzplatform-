The Preservation of Sound Recordings in Archival Repositories
Thomas R. Doyle March 2001
Sound recordings are found in many archival repositories today. From early
examples of sound recording technology such as wax cylinders to the ubiquitous
cassette tape, these media preserve music, speech and sounds that are a valuable part
of our cultural legacy. Historians find that listening to the recorded voice provides an
immediacy and context to events that is very useful for historical research but often
missing from the documentary record.1 Recordings made by anthropologists of the
language of indigenous peoples are of great interest to both their descendants and
scholars. Often archives hold the only copies of important musical recordings. The
challenge for archivists is to preserve these valuable sound recordings and to provide
access to researchers and the general public.
The Challenge
The archivist who seeks to preserve sound recordings needs to be concerned
with climate control, storage conditions and intrinsic faults in the media themselves.
Overly hot conditions will render analog tapes unusable. Disk recordings are prone to
warpage if they are stored incorrectly. Acetate disks may develop a white powder
that looks like mold but is actually a byproduct of the manufacturing process.2 But
an even greater challenge to the preservation of these recordings is the technological
obsolescence of much of the sound recording and playback equipment. Analog tape
recording equipment is quickly being withdrawn from the marketplace and spare
parts for older reel-to-reel machines have become increasingly difficult to find. The
newer equipment and formats that are replacing it have not been fully tested and their
suitability for long-term storage is unknown. Because of the technological
obsolescence of recording equipment and the limited life span of existing media the
archivist must be concerned with the issue of preservation re-recording. There are
also preservation considerations involved in providing for the use and access of audio
recordings by researchers.
2
The Literature
Fortunately, a considerable body of scholarship exists to guide the archivist
on the preservation of sound recordings. Much of the literature is quite technical in
nature, and requires a basic knowledge of sound recording media. This is obtainable
from some of the general, book length treatments on the subject.3 A number of
articles on the topic have been published in archival journals such as American
Archivist and the Journal of the Association of Recorded Sound Collections, with
several appearing in the past five years. Overall, the recent literature is differentiated
more by its emphasis than by a substantive difference of opinion over the facts.
Authors tend to focus on some specific aspect of sound recording preservation and
then proceed to examine the issue from that perspective. By combining the different
approaches a good overview of the major issues of sound recording preservation that
concern the archivist today can be obtained.
Sound Recording Media
This discussion will focus on the categories of sound recordings most
commonly found in archives today. These include wax cylinders, grooved
phonodisks and magnetic tapes. Wax cylinders are an early form of recording that
was developed by Alexander Graham Bell and associates in 1885 for use with the
phonograph.4 Grooved phonodisks include 78s, 45s and 33 rpm recordings on shellac
and vinyl bases along with acetates, a type of instantaneous recording. Magnetic tape
that is used with analog recorders ranges in size from 2” wide open reel tapes to 1/8”
cassette tapes. The most commonly used tape in archival repositories today begins at
1/4“ in width.5 Special attention will be given to magnetic tape, a major sound
recording medium held in modern archives. More recently introduced media include
compact disks (CDs) and digital audiotape (DAT). Each of these media has specific
preservation requirements for climate control and storage.
ANSI Standards
Peter Z. Adelstein of the Image Permanence Institute recommends that
archivists use the ANSI standards for recording media (and imaging materials) to help
3
resolve the differences that arise out of the varied backgrounds found among authors
who write on the issue of their preservation.6 The ANSI committee (IT9) is
composed of representatives of industry, government, archivists and universities and
research laboratories. Representatives from Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom
also regularly attend meetings, ensuring international input. There are several
standards written for storage of different sound recording media by ANSI. A specific
standard exists for the storage of polyester base magnetic tape and for estimating the
effects of temperature and relative humidity on compact disks, magneto-optic disks
and CD-R disks.7 Each standard features an in-depth discussion on the preservation
of the media and can be ordered directly from the ANSI. These standards can assist
the archivist in planning adequate storage conditions for their audio collections.
Climate Control
Richard Warren Jr. takes an in-depth look at the issue of climate control as a
factor in storage.8 Effective climate control in an archival repository, he believes, is
essential to the preservation of audio recordings. Warren recommends different
standards for heating, ventilation and air conditioning for areas where service copies
and preservation copies are kept. He bases his conclusions on data gathered from
studies conducted in 1987 by the Associated Audio Archives committee (AAA) of the
Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC). For service copies a room
should be kept at 68 degrees Fahrenheit with a relative humidity of 45%. Fluctuations
in humidity should be kept to a minimum (+ or – 5%). For long-term storage of tape
recordings 50 degrees (but no lower) is optimum. A period of twenty-four hours is
needed to acclimate these recordings before playback. Wax cylinders are best stored
at 55 degrees. The ideal humidity for preservation is 25% for tapes and 45% for
cylinders. Although ideal conditions are difficult to achieve, Warren points to an
(ANSI) study that found the most important factor in climate control is to maintain
stability in temperatures and relative humidity.9 Archives holding sound collections
should strive to minimize large-scale fluctuations in temperature and humidity in their
storage areas.

Storage
Along with climate control there are a number of other storage-related issues
to be considered in the preservation of sound recordings. Warren discusses the
factors of lighting, electromagnetic radiation, security and individual storage in the
preservation of these media. Natural lighting is discouraged and the use of
fluorescent lighting with ballasts is prohibited due to their output of electric and
magnetic fields that can harm sound recordings. Monitoring for these fields, also
generated by radios and televisions, may be necessary in some cases. Individual item
storage requirements vary for the different media although in general, Warren
recommends the use of supports, dividers and props to store all sound recordings.
Cylinders need to be stored on end and grooved disks (including compact disks)
should be stored vertically and separated by size. Cassettes need to be stored
horizontally and a rack is recommended. Open-reel tapes should be stored on slotless
NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) reels in plastic containers with the tape
horizontal to the shelf.10 Analog tapes, often used to record original sound
recordings, present some serious preservation challenges for the archivist.
Preservation of Magnetic Tape
Dr. John W.C. Van Bogart of the National Media Laboratory has conducted
an in-depth study on the storage and handling of magnetic (audio and video) tape .11
In the report he discusses what can go wrong with magnetic media and how to
prevent early degradation of tape. There are three parts of a magnetic tape -
magnetic particles, binder and backing. Under average conditions the binder rather
than the magnetic particles determine the longevity of tape. When the binder, that
holds the magnetic particles to tape, is damaged through excessive heat or dryness a
condition called tape hydrolysis (commonly known as sticky shed syndrome) can
develop and make the tape unplayable. Other problems with magnetic tape, detailed
in Bogart’s report, are lubricant loss, magnetic particle instability and substrate
deformation. The problems of tape hydrolysis and lubricant loss are especially
common with cassette tapes.12 The relatively short life span of cassettes, due to these
5
problems, and because of breakage, prevents most researchers from recommending
them as an archival medium.
Life Expectancy of Tape
In addition to guidelines for proper climate control Bogart offers some
practical suggestions for extending the life of tapes. These include the importance of
a clean storage area, taking care not to drop tapes and the necessity of keeping tapes
out of sunlight and away from water, radiators, televisions, windowsills and
electronic equipment. A period of acclimatization is necessary when moving tapes
out of climate control storage areas for use by researchers. Certain procedures such as
frequent access and handling can shorten the life expectancy of a tape. The
maximum life expectancy of an open reel tape is approximately thirty years
depending on factors such as tape quality and storage conditions. In order to preserve
the information on a tape the re-recording of a tape at some time will be necessary.
Looking at the differences between analog and digital tape Bogart notes that one
advantage of analog tape is that its loss is steady and quantifiable over time, allowing
re-recording before the complete loss of sound quality. A digital tape though will
show little indication before a sudden catastrophic loss of large portions of recorded
information.13 For that reason, re-recording on analog tape seems to be the best
option currently available.
Preservation Re-recording
Christopher Ann Paton advocates a multi-part approach to archival work
on sound recordings that involves assessing an audio collection, preparing for its
preservation and ultimately planning a re-recording project.14 Assessing a collection
involves identifying vulnerable recordings and determining the sizes, speeds and
formats of recordings. Paton provides detailed discussions of the different types of
media and their preservation problems. The issue of preservation re-recording is the
major focus of his article. He uses the definition of the Television Coordinating
Committee (TCC) that calls preservation re-recording “a means to preserve the
original sonic content of a recording ….The archivists function is to preserve history,
6
not to rewrite it.” Therefore the use of filtering and noise enhancement or suppression
is to be avoided when making master copies but can be used for service copies. 15
The basic concept of preservation re-recording is not concerned with specific
technologies but rather with the maintenance of the original sound quality of a
recording.
Analog Technology
In his article Paton offers a number of useful recommendations for making
preservation transfers. He suggests employing analog technology and using new reelto
reel tape with an overall thickness of 1.5 millimeters. Recording should be done in
full-track format for mono originals and half-track for stereo original sources at a
minimum seed of 7.5 inches per second (ips). Tapes should be stored on metal NAB
unslotted hubs. Splices should be avoided and a series of test tones are to be recorded
at the beginning of the tape. He notes that re-recording is costly and time consuming
with estimates for time being two-and-a-half times the original playing time of each
tape.16 While suggesting the use of analog technology Paton does not offer any
solutions to the dilemma of the problem of the technological obsolescence of that
equipment. How does an archive maintain existing analog equipment where parts and
service are no longer easily available? An Internet search of reel-to- reel tape
recorder manufacturers located only two companies that still produce this equipment:
Studer/Revox and Otari. Inexpensive consumer models have been discontinued with
only professional grade models available at substantially higher prices. One option
might be to buy a used model from one of these two manufacturers and rely on their
existing service centers for maintenance of the equipment.17 This is only a shortterm
solution though; a hedge until a suitable digital re-recording archival format
becomes available.
Digital Technology
The digital technology that is available today is new and still developing,
making many archivists wary of employing this technology for preservation rerecording.
Some of the problems with digital media addressed by Paton include
7
sampling rates, longevity and hardware obsolescence. The sampling rate describes
how a “sound wave is “sampled “ and converted to binary code by use of an analogto-
digital converter (ADC).”18 A standard has not been developed yet for the
optimum sampling rates for making digital copies and there are a variety of opinions
on the issue. The longevity of digital media like CD-R’s is still unknown. Paton
warns that DAT (digital audiotape) should never be used for preservation purposes.19
Hardware obsolescence for digital media is a major problem since manufacturers are
constantly introducing new technology without concern for the continued viability of
older digital media and hardware. Despite a large staff with an abundance of
equipment and spare parts it took six months for the LBJ Library to find a machine
that would play an obsolete databelt. The machine was finally obtained from IBM’s
Museum.20 Despite archivists’ reservations digital technology is being widely used
today by recording studios and audio technicians who are less concerned with the
longevity of recordings. They believe digital media has less distortion than analog
and can produce copies from master tapes without a loss in quality. Other sound
engineers dispute these assertions.21 The best use for digital technology in archives at
the present time, until longevity concerns are addressed, may be to improve access to
existing analog recordings.
Access
Archives are challenged by the need to provide public access to audio
materials in their collection. Original masters should never be used for service
copies. A second service copy should be made instead.22 A viable option is to make
a digital (CD-R) service copy when re-recording a tape. The researcher can easily
play this copy on a dedicated computer. If the service copy is damaged a second copy
can be made from the master. Archivists have found that users of sound and video
recordings need collections processed at the item level23. Cataloging at the item level
should be a priority when re-recording a tape. A computerized item level catalog,
when combined with digital service copies, will improve public access to sound
recordings and make the best present use of the new technology.

Future Trends
In 1997 the Library of Congress, believing that new ways to insure the
preservation of audio and video material were needed, commissioned a study by
William D. Storm to look at the issue.24 For the study eleven Federal groups were
interviewed, including the American Folklife Center, Music Division, National
Digital Library and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division
(MBRS). A list of needs was summarized for any new technology to be developed.
Some of the needs highlighted for the new technology are the following capabilities:
the ability to produce master preservation-quality copies, to facilitate access to audio
and video materials to the public, to address technological obsolescence and
migration strategy of media and to co-exist with current technologies and operational
methodologies. A number of manufacturers were invited to make presentations on a
specific set of related questions and a site visit was made to Sony Division
headquarters to look at a digitally based system they have developed.
Recommendations were made to adopt a unified strategy for the development of a
new technology.25
The Unified Strategy
The unified strategy recommends the use of a common system that is
capable of making preservation copies of both audio and video recordings. This
equipment must be able to generate both preservation and service copies at the same
time. It must also be able to manage associated material including images and text.
Access can continue to be provided through MARC records. The new technology
will be digital but existing analog equipment must be maintained until original analog
material can be converted to digital. Because of the rapid technology shift that is
occurring simply improving existing storage conditions is not enough. While the
software needed for the system is fairly simple it still has to be developed and the
issue studied.26 The study is suggesting what is truly a paradigm shift in the way
recordings, both audio and visual, are preserved for the future.
9
A New Medium
The Library of Congress study found that the digital optical tape format
holds great promise for purposes of the preservation of sound and video recordings.
This media, with capabilities of storing motion picture quality images, has yet to be
produced due to manufacturers concerns about market size and profitability. The
study recommends that the Library of Congress should focus on promoting digital
optical tape, in the way it focused on developing acid-free papers, to provide a
catalyst to encourage its manufacture.27 Adelstein notes that digital optical disks are
relatively stable as an archival format.28 Storm’s report also states that the Library of
Congress should adopt a Digital Information Life Assurance (DILAP) policy when
acquiring new equipment to deal with the problem of technological obsolescence.
This policy would require the manufacturer to not only sell a product but to maintain
a process. The technology adopted by the Library will have far reaching impact on
other repositories so the institution needs to take a leadership position to develop
national and international standards.29 Hopefully this report has spurred movement
toward development of a digital system that will be manufactured for both the
consumer and professional markets, and will be available and affordable to archival
repositories.
Conclusion
The preservation of sound recordings requires the archivist to have a basic
knowledge in several different areas. One must understand the climate control and
storage requirements of each the various media. The use of ANSI standards and the
available literature on the subject will help the archivist learn about and implement
the needed steps to insure sound recording preservation. To guarantee the longevity
of sound recordings it is necessary to employ the technique of preservation rerecording.
Analog tape recorder technology is still the best option presently for the
maintenance of sound recordings and analog equipment should be maintained for this
purpose. Digital technology, while promising, is still unproven as an archival storage
medium but can improve access to collections. The Library of Congress research into
the development of an archival digital medium, probably on optical disks, holds great
10
promise. This technology, once developed, tested and manufactured will allow the rerecording
of the older media and improve public access to sound recordings in
archives.

Sound Recording Media
This discussion will focus on the categories of sound recordings most

phonodisks and magnetic tapes. Wax cylinders are an early form of recording that

ANSI Standards
Peter Z. Adelstein of the Image Permanence Institute recommends that
archivists use the ANSI standards for recording media (and imaging materials) to help
3
resolve the differences that arise out of the varied backgrounds found among authors
who write on the issue of their preservation.6 The ANSI committee (IT9) is
composed of representatives of industry, government, archivists and universities and

also regularly attend meetings, ensuring international input. There are several

essential to the preservation of audio recordings. Warren recommends different
standards for heating, ventilation and air conditioning for areas where service copies

NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) reels in plastic containers with the tape
horizontal to the shelf.10 Analog tapes, often used to record original sound
recordings, present some serious preservation challenges for the archivist.

In his article Paton offers a number of useful recommendations for making
preservation transfers. He suggests employing analog technology and using new reelto
reel tape with an overall thickness of 1.5 millimeters. Recording should be done in
full-track format for mono originals and half-track for stereo original sources at a
minimum seed of 7.5 inches per second (ips). Tapes should be stored on metal NAB
unslotted hubs. Splices should be avoided and a series of test tones are to be recorded
at the beginning of the tape. He notes that re-recording is costly and time consuming
with estimates for time being two-and-a-half times the original playing time of each
tape.16 While suggesting the use of analog technology Paton does not offer any
solutions to the dilemma of the problem of the technological obsolescence of that
equipment. How does an archive maintain existing analog equipment where parts and
service are no longer easily available? An Internet search of reel-to- reel tape
recorder manufacturers located only two companies that still produce this equipment:
Studer/Revox and Otari. Inexpensive consumer models have been discontinued with
only professional grade models available at substantially higher prices. One option
might be to buy a used model from one of these two manufacturers and rely on their
existing service centers for maintenance of the equipment.17 This is only a shortterm
solution though; a hedge until a suitable digital re-recording archival format
becomes available.
Digital Technology
The digital technology that is available today is new and still developing,
making many archivists wary of employing this technology for preservation rerecording.
Some of the problems with digital media addressed by Paton include
7
sampling rates, longevity and hardware obsolescence. The sampling rate describes
how a “sound wave is “sampled “ and converted to binary code by use of an analogto-
digital converter (ADC).”18 A standard has not been developed yet for the
optimum sampling rates for making digital copies and there are a variety of opinions
on the issue. The longevity of digital media like CD-R’s is still unknown. Paton
warns that DAT (digital audiotape) should never be used for preservation purposes.19
Hardware obsolescence for digital media is a major problem since manufacturers are
constantly introducing new technology without concern for the continued viability of
older digital media and hardware. Despite a large staff with an abundance of
equipment and spare parts it took six months for the LBJ Library to find a machine
that would play an obsolete databelt. The machine was finally obtained from IBM’s
Museum.20 Despite archivists’ reservations digital technology is being widely used
today by recording studios and audio technicians who are less concerned with the
longevity of recordings. They believe digital media has less distortion than analog
and can produce copies from master tapes without a loss in quality. Other sound
engineers dispute these assertions.21 The best use for digital technology in archives at
the present time, until longevity concerns are addressed, may be to improve access to
existing analog recordings.
Access
Archives are challenged by the need to provide public access to audio
materials in their collection. Original masters should never be used for service
copies. A second service copy should be made instead.22 A viable option is to make
a digital (CD-R) service copy when re-recording a tape. The researcher can easily
play this copy on a dedicated computer. If the service copy is damaged a second copy
can be made from the master. Archivists have found that users of sound and video
recordings need collections processed at the item level23. Cataloging at the item level
should be a priority when re-recording a tape. A computerized item level catalog,
when combined with digital service copies, will improve public access to sound
recordings and make the best present use of the new technology.

Future Trends
In 1997 the Library of Congress, believing that new ways to insure the
preservation of audio and video material were needed, commissioned a study by
William D. Storm to look at the issue.24 For the study eleven Federal groups were
interviewed, including the American Folklife Center, Music Division, National
Digital Library and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division
(MBRS). A list of needs was summarized for any new technology to be developed.
Some of the needs highlighted for the new technology are the following capabilities:
the ability to produce master preservation-quality copies, to facilitate access to audio
and video materials to the public, to address technological obsolescence and
migration strategy of media and to co-exist with current technologies and operational
methodologies. A number of manufacturers were invited to make presentations on a
specific set of related questions and a site visit was made to Sony Division
headquarters to look at a digitally based system they have developed.
Recommendations were made to adopt a unified strategy for the development of a
new technology.25
The Unified Strategy
The unified strategy recommends the use of a common system that is
capable of making preservation copies of both audio and video recordings. This
equipment must be able to generate both preservation and service copies at the same
time. It must also be able to manage associated material including images and text.
Access can continue to be provided through MARC records. The new technology
will be digital but existing analog equipment must be maintained until original analog
material can be converted to digital. Because of the rapid technology shift that is
occurring simply improving existing storage conditions is not enough. While the
software needed for the system is fairly simple it still has to be developed and the
issue studied.26 The study is suggesting what is truly a paradigm shift in the way
recordings, both audio and visual, are preserved for the future.
9
A New Medium
The Library of Congress study found that the digital optical tape format
holds great promise for purposes of the preservation of sound and video recordings.
This media, with capabilities of storing motion picture quality images, has yet to be
produced due to manufacturers concerns about market size and profitability. The
study recommends that the Library of Congress should focus on promoting digital
optical tape, in the way it focused on developing acid-free papers, to provide a
catalyst to encourage its manufacture.27 Adelstein notes that digital optical disks are
relatively stable as an archival format.28 Storm’s report also states that the Library of
Congress should adopt a Digital Information Life Assurance (DILAP) policy when
acquiring new equipment to deal with the problem of technological obsolescence.
This policy would require the manufacturer to not only sell a product but to maintain
a process. The technology adopted by the Library will have far reaching impact on
other repositories so the institution needs to take a leadership position to develop
national and international standards.29 Hopefully this report has spurred movement
toward development of a digital system that will be manufactured for both the
consumer and professional markets, and will be available and affordable to archival
repositories.
Conclusion
The preservation of sound recordings requires the archivist to have a basic
knowledge in several different areas. One must understand the climate control and
storage requirements of each the various media. The use of ANSI standards and the
available literature on the subject will help the archivist learn about and implement
the needed steps to insure sound recording preservation. To guarantee the longevity
of sound recordings it is necessary to employ the technique of preservation rerecording.
Analog tape recorder technology is still the best option presently for the
maintenance of sound recordings and analog equipment should be maintained for this
purpose. Digital technology, while promising, is still unproven as an archival storage
medium but can improve access to collections. The Library of Congress research into
the development of an archival digital medium, probably on optical disks, holds great
10
promise. This technology, once developed, tested and manufactured will allow the rerecording
of the older media and improve public access to sound recordings in
archives.

17 This problem is not addressed in the recent literature. The discussion results from
my professional experience in obtaining a reel-to-reel recorder for the Keene State
College, Orang Asli Archive at. The archive chose the option of purchasing a used
Otari recorder in good condition, at one-tenth the cost of a new model, and having it
serviced by an Otari service technician.
