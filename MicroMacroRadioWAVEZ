YouTube Video Subscriptions - Ahuka | 2015-06-26


Although my wife and I have a Cable TV subscription, I have maintained I could give it up easily because so much of what I am interested in is online anyway. For many people that might mean Netflix or Hulu, but for me it means YouTube. This is the golden age of narrow-casting, as opposed to broadcasting, because YouTube gives so many creators the opportunity to find their own audience for things that dont appeal to the masses. For more go to http://www.palain.com/?p=243

12-Tone Music and My Random 12 Tone Row of the Day - Jon Kulp | 2015-06-18


12-Tone Music (Dodecaphony) and My Random 12 Tone Row of the Day

In this episode I cover a bit of music theory as well as some bash scripting. The topic is the Twelve-Tone System of music composition and the scripting of a random 12-tone row to be generated daily. For a full transcript of the show click here.

Penguicon 2015 Report - Ahuka | 2015-06-12


Penguicon 2015 is a combined technology and science fiction convention in Southfield, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, and presented over 500 hours of programming over the entire weekend. Of this, around 100 hours were open source, tech-related. In this episode I give you my personal diary of my experience at this great event.

The Ubuntu Quickly Ebook Template and Ebooks in General - Jon Kulp | 2015-06-11


Ubuntu Quickly Ebook Template

I recorded this conversation with Mike Hingley about a year ago (12 June 2014) but never released it because I thought the audio didn't sound very good and I didn't feel like editing it at the time. Honestly I forgot all about it until now when the HPR queue is low again. I apologize for the slightly clippy quality of my audio, I must have had my microphone too hot on the mumble. It's really interesting to listen to this conversation a year later because I have worked out so many of the problems that I was mentioning to Mike, including the automation of the entire build process using command-line tools from Calibre.

Intro to the Fugue and the Open Well-Tempered Clavier - Jon Kulp | 2015-06-04


Intro to the Fugue

This episode of HPR is inspired by the recent release of a new recording by Kimiko Ishizaka of J.S. Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I. This is a very special recording because it is free and open, licensed to be shared freely forever. The recording was crowdfunded and immediately released with a public license after editing. This allows for legal remixing and sharing, and also makes it perfect for stuff like I do in this episode—cutting the recordings up for inserting as musical examples and then presenting the whole thing for your listening enjoyment.

Full Show Notes

Please see the full show notes for detailed descriptions of the parts of a fugue and a few musical examples as well.

Router Hacking - Jon Kulp | 2015-05-21


Router Hacking

What
•Flashing a router with alternate firmware

Why
•Provide additional features
•Improve performance
•Privacy (gets rid of unwanted spyware)
•Fun

Where
•The DD-WRT Router Database: http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database
•Tomato Firmware for Linksys WRT54G/GL/GS: http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato
•OpenWRT firmware: https://openwrt.org/

How: Steps for My Latest Hack
1.Find used Netgear WNDR3400 router on shelf at local Goodwill store, priced at $3.99.
2.Use my smartphone to check the dd-wrt database to see if this router is hackable.
3.Grin broadly upon seeing the green "Yes" beside router WNDR3400.
4.Double-check that power supply is included, find an AC outlet and plug in to be sure it powers on and my phone sees its ESSID. Yep and yep.
5.Take router to cashier and purchase.
6.Do hard reset of router to clear any previous configuration.
7.Hook a laptop up to router using ethernet patch cable (turning off WiFi adapter on laptop).
8.Access router's configuration in web browser at default router address of 192.168.1.1 just to confirm that it works.
9.Go back to the dd-wrt router database and find the router again, then download the corresponding "mini" and the "mega" versions of dd-wrt firmware (The mega version has the most features—including USB support, which I wanted—but on many routers, including this one, you have to install the mini version first or else you could brick the router)
10.Read over the dd-wrt wiki page for this specific router just to see if there's anything unusual about the hack. There's not.
11.Go to the router's stock configuration page again and find the "Firmware upgrade" button.
12.Click the button and choose the "mini" version of the dd-wrt firmware, and click upgrade, then wait while crossing fingers until it says firmware successfully upgraded.
13.Refresh the configuration page at 192.168.1.1 and see the new dd-wrt configuration interface.
14.Pat myself on the back because I have just hacked another router. Hray!
15.Find the upgrade firmware area on the new dd-wrt interface, and this time choose the "mega" firmware file and submit, then wait and cross fingers as before. Celebrate when it works. 
16.Configure newly hacked router as wireless bridge (this is NOT going to be my main router), enable the USB and printer support, hook up our formerly-usb-only printer to the router, and configure household computers to be able to print wirelessly to the newly-networked printer.
17.Enjoy kudos from appreciative family.

Sox of Silence - Ken Fallon | 2015-05-11


Many of you may be aware of the "truncate silence" filter in audacity. As I already use SOX to speed up my podcasts, I wanted to see if it could also remove silence as well. While the man page is detailed, it is difficult to follow. http://sox.sourceforge.net/ 

Fortunately Jason Navarrete posted an excellent article on digitalcardboard.com called The SoX of Silence which went through the process step by step http://digitalcardboard.com/blog/2009/08/25/the-sox-of-silence/ 

The Script
    # -S, --show-progress
    # -V verbose
    # tempo Change the audio playback speed but not its pitch. 
    # remix Select and mix input audio channels into output audio channels. 
    # remix - performs a mix-down of all input channels to mono.
    # silence Removes silence from the beginning, middle, or end of the audio.
    # http://digitalcardboard.com/blog/2009/08/25/the-sox-of-silence/
    # 
    sox -S -v2 "${FILENAME}" "${FILENAME}-faster-${SPEED}.ogg" -V9 tempo ${SPEED} remix - silence 1 0.1 1% -1 0.1 1%

Introduction to Rogue Class Linux - Frank Bell | 2015-05-07


Rogue Class describes itself as "a toy Linux distribution for playing games and reading books. RCL favors turn-based games, such as puzzles and rogue-like games. " 

What are Rogue Class games? According to a link at the Rogue Class website, Rogue Class games are characterized by 


•"Tactical play. The unit of action is based on the individual adventurer. The game is not twitch oriented (like Quake, rewarding reflexes & well trained actions) nor is it strategy oriented (like Civilizations or Warcraft, requiring working on the large picture)
•"Based in Hack and Slash. A roguelike isn't primarily about plot development or telling a story. It is about killing things and acquiring treasure.
•"Random games. A roguelike is a dungeon crawler where no two games are the same. The maps are different, the items are different, there are no guaranteed win paths.
•"Permadeath. You die, that is it. No restoring a savegame. Good roguelikes delete your save game after loading them. This is compensated by the replayability of the game.
•"Complex interactions of properties. While the commands for a roguelike are simple, the potential interactions are not. My favourite example is equipping a silver ring as a weapon in order to damage a creature vulnerable to silver, but not one's other weapons. [Editor: This matches the Hack branch of the roguelike tree, not the Angband branch]

Rogue Class contains four dozen or so games, two of which are actually categories which in turn contain additional games, as well as a number of utilities, including a network manager, an IRC client, and more. Some representative games include the following, picked quite at random: Angband, Fargoal, Magus, Moria, Nethack, and Tome. 

If you liked the old games, give Rogue Class a spin.

pdftk: the PDF Toolkit - Jon Kulp | 2015-05-01


Hacking Apart and Re-Assembling PDFs

Extract pages 3–5 from file foobar.pdf:
pdftk foobar.pdf cat 3-5 output excerpt.pdf


Same thing but also grab the cover page:
pdftk foobar.pdf cat 1 3-5 output excerpt.pdf


Combine multiple PDFs:
pdftk file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf cat output combined.pdf


Reassemble a 50-page document with all of the pages in reverse order (I once actually did this for my wife and she was very grateful—she had scanned an article at the library and it ended up with all of the pages in the wrong order from last to first. This command solved her problem in about one second.):
pdftk wrongorder.pdf cat 50-1 output rightorder.pdf


Check the pdftk man page for all kinds of other manipulations you can do, including "bursting" a PDF into its component pages, rotating pages in any direction, applying password protection, etc. 

Embedding “Bookmarks” as a Table of Contents

You can also use pdftk to embed a table of contents in a flat PDF file. This is incredibly useful, as it can make large, unwieldy files very easy to navigate. All you have to do is add some bookmark data in a fairly straightforward format as shown below. As a starting point you should that dump the current metadata content of the file with this command:
pdftk foobar.pdf dump_data_utf8


Save the contents of this data dump in a text file and then add bookmark information just below the NumberOfPages value. Here is an excerpt from the huge anthology of public-domain scores I assembled for my music history class:
InfoBegin
InfoKey: ModDate
InfoValue: D:20150106100000-06'00'

BookmarkPageNumber: 256
BookmarkBegin
BookmarkTitle: Beethoven 5: IV. Allegro
BookmarkLevel: 2
BookmarkPageNumber: 275


And here is the command to update the PDF with the table of contents embedded. This tells it to take the input file foobar.pdf and update its metadata using the file foobar.info (with utf8 encoding) and output the results as foobar_with_toc.pdf.
pdftk foobar.pdf update_info_utf8 foobar.info output foobar_with_toc.pdf

D7? Why Seven? - Jon Kulp | 2015-04-23


In this episode I respond to one of the community-requested topics ("Music Theory") and try to explain what seventh chords are and why they are used. Below are some of the terms that I use in the course of the discussion.
•Interval: The distance between two pitches (sounded either consecutively or simultaneously)
•Consonance: Relatively stable sound between two or more pitches
•Dissonance: Relatively unstable sound between two or more pitches. Dissonance often needs a "resolution" to consonance
•Chord: three or more notes sounded together 
•Chord progression: a succession of chords 
•Triad: a chord with 3 pitches, the adjacent pitches separated by the interval of the 3rd.
•Seventh chord: a chord with 4 pitches, the adjacent pitches separated by the interval of the 3rd.
•Tonality: harmonic system that governs the use of major and minor keys
•Tonic: the central tone of a piece of music
•Mode: major or minor [e.g. Symphony no. 5 in C minor]
•Modulation: the process of changing keys within a piece of music 
•Scale: Ascending or descending series of notes that define a key or tonality, with a specific arrangements of half-steps and whole-steps. Major and Minor scales are most common in Western music

Introducing a 5 year old to Sugar on Toast - amp | 2015-04-22


This was me introducing my 5 year old to her new laptop with Sugar on Toast. 

A family member had no use for an old 7 year old netbook so I installed the trisquel version of Sugar, the one laptop per child operating system. 

This is a response to this episode: http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1726 I find it ticks all the boxes. 

Recorded with a phone and spoken mainly in a different language. I did conversion to FLAC from a mono mp3 probably the same if I just uploaded the MP3 directly. No editing was done.

Scale 13x Part 6 of 6 - Lord Drachenblut | 2015-04-16


I am 13 years old and live in Santa Barbara. I have participated in the Open Source community for several years. My dad has been on the SCALE leadership team for a long time, and he introduced me to programming. My favorite programming languages are HTML and Javascript with Enyo because I like creating websites and webOS apps. I also program in Shell and some Python, and like making short animations using Blender. I have recently made the world's first emulator for the WITCH, the first currently working fixed-point decimal computer. I recently earned my Technician Amateur Radio license and enjoy attending radio club meetings. Besides geeking, I like to swim, act, and do fun events with the Boy Scouts.

Lord Drachenblut introduces himself


 Website: http://www.gofundme.com/gysc0o 

Greetings everyone. I'm Matthew ”Lord Drachenblut" Williams. I'm currently working on gathering the fund to attend the Southern California Linux Expo aka SCALE. As many of you already know I have spent the last year struggling against esophageal cancer. I am nearing a point which I can start traveling and attending conferences again. My goal is to raise the funds so that in February of 2015 I can attend Scale. I am also working on a talk that I hope to give at SCALE. My sincerest thanks to the community that has been there for me during my recovery and to those that will help me in this endeavor. Should I raise more funds than needed to attend SCALE my goal will be to submit my talk to other conferences and to give my talk at those as well.

Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud. 

Fedora Activity Day

The Fedora Activity Day (FAD) is a regional event (either one-day or a multi-day) that allows Fedora contributors to gather together in order to work on specific tasks related to the Fedora Project.

How to Get Yourself On an Open Source Podcast - Presentation for Kansas Linux Fest, 22 March 2015 - FiftyOneFifty | 2015-04-07


Howdy folks, this is 5150 for Hacker Public Radio. What you are about to hear is a presentation titled "How to Get Yourself on an Open Source Podcast" that I delivered at Kansas Linux Fest on 22 March 2015. Since it was not recorded (I was told the SD card was full), and there has been interest expressed by my fellow podcasters, I thought it might be worth re-recording. I am afraid Mike Dupont is not satisfied with any of the video from KLF 2015, this may be the only talk from that event you get to hear. However, show notes are extensive, http://lanyrd.com/2015/klf15/schedule/ All I can tell you is, three out of the four audience members seemed to enjoy my presentation. I shall deliver the rest of this podcast as if you gentile listeners were my live audience. 

A. Howdy folks, my name is Don Grier. I'm an IT consultant and farmer from South Central Kansas. I am also a podcaster. You might recognize my voice from such podcasts as Hacker Public Radio, the Kernel Panic Oggcast, or Linux LUG Cast, where I use the handle, FiftyOneFifty. 

I. When fellow Hacker Public Radio host Mike Dupont told me KLF would be a reality, I struggled to find a topic that I knew well enough to give a talk about. It was almost in jest that I said I could talk about "How to Get Yourself on an Open Source Podcast". Actually, since that was as far as my proposal went, I was shocked and honored to find myself on the same roster with so many other speakers with impressive credentials and technical topics. 

II. This afternoon, I hope not only to chronicle my personal history with Linux and open source related podcasts, but to show you why I believe podcasting can be as an important part of giving back to the community as contributing code, or documentation, or cash. Linux podcasts bind the community by providing education, both as basic as Linux Reality or as specific as GNU World Order. Podcasts announce new innovations, and tell us of Free and Open Source software adoption and opposition in corporations and governments. Podcasts herald community events like this one, and provide a little humor at the end of a long day. 

B. Some of you may wonder why I'm using old school technology to organize my notes at a high tech conference. At this point, 5150 holds up several stapled sheets of paper in large print. The plain and simple truth is that I can't read my phone or tablet with my glasses on; and I'm already using bifocals. It just seems every time I get new glasses, the lower lenses work for about two weeks, then I have to take then off to see the phone. But this last time I figured I'd outsmart my the system and just order a single focus lenses. I was still congratulating myself on my thriftiness when I put my new glasses on, sat down at the computer, and realized I couldn't read the keyboard. 

C. Before I talk about my history as a podcaster, I think I should tell you my history with Linux. 

I. My first experience with Linux was with a boxed set of Mandrake 7.2 around 2002. I always maintain at least a second running system in the house, in case the primary machine coughs up a hairball. I'd always been a geek alternative OS's, and I wanted a tertiary machine on my network that wouldn't be affected by the propagation of Windows viruses. 

a. There wasn't much flash to Linux apps in those days, I recall I was not impressed by whichever browser shipped with Mandrake. I don't recall what I knew about installing additional applications from repositories, but in any case I was still on dialup. 

b. The Pentium I that I installed Mandrake on had both a modem and an Ethernet card. The installer asked which one I used to reach the Internet, and only set up one of the two devices. This annoyed me as I'd planned to use the Linux box as a gateway to see if it would save a few CPU cycles on the P4 I used as a gaming machine back then. I really wouldn't have know where to go on the Internet for help, and I expect help would not be as forth coming 13 years ago. 

II. My next experience with Linux came around 2007. The school I consulted for had several Windows 98 machines not compatible with the software they wanted to run. Even though the machines were P4's, we determined the cost of XP plus memory upgrades could better be applied to new machines. As a result, I was able to bring several of the machines home. Over time, I boosted their memory with used sticks from eBay, and even the odd faster processor. As a noob, I installed Feisty Fawn on a system out in the machine shed, and spent a lot of that winter hacking on that box when I should have been overhauling tractors. Just as I was delving into NDIS wrappers, Gusty brought support for my Gigabyte wireless card, which combined with a double fork isolating power box, gave me reasonable certainty that the box out in the shed was safe from lightning storms. About six months later, I rescued up a refugee from a major meteorological event and set it up in my house running Mint. For the first time I didn't have to leave the house to get my Linux on. 

D. Just before I set up that first Linux box, we finally got broadband out to the farm, and I'd discovered podcasts. I figured there must be Linux podcasts to go along the general tech and computing podcasts I followed, as well as a fondly remembered weekly SciFi revue show that started out as a Sunday afternoon show on a Wichita radio station, was canceled twice, and re-emerged as a semi weekly podcast, only to disappear forever a couple months after I started listening again, but not before I download all the episodes I missed. 

I. In my initial search for Linux related content, all I came up with were four drunk off their ass Scots discussing the minutia of Ruby on Rails. While I liked the format, I lacked the commitment to become a Ruby programmer so I could understand the show. 

II. A few days later I came across "The Techie Geek". Russ Wenner mixed tutorials with reviews of new applications and upcoming events. Better yet, he introduced me to a world of other Linux podcasts. Through "The Techie Geek", I learned of the irreverent banter of the "Linux Outlaws", the subdued studiousness of what was then called "The Bad Apples", the contained chaos of the "Linux Cranks", the classroom like atmosphere of the "Linux Basement" during Chad's Drupal tutorial period, tech hints and movie reviews delivered at the speed of 75 miles per hour by Dave Yates of "Lotta Linux Links", the auditory dissonance of "The Linux Link Tech Show", and the constant daily variety of "Hacker Public Radio". 

E. In 2010, I made my first contribution to Hacker Public Radio. The great thing about HPR is that there is no vetting process, we only ask your audio be intelligible (not polished, not even good, we just have to be able to understand you) and that the topic be of interest to geeks. If you consider yourself a geek, any topic that interests you is welcome. There is no maximum or minimum runtime, just get the show uploaded on-time. While topics tend concern open source, this is not a requirement. I believe my second HPR concerned how to migrate Windows wireless connection profiles between systems. I'd spent a few hours figuring it out one day for a customer and I thought I should consolidate what I learned in one place. HPR provides a podcasting platform at no cost to the podcaster. It serves as both a venue for broadcasters without the resources to host their own site or without the time to commit to a regular schedule. It can also serve as an incubator for hosts trying to find their own audience. It's never been easier to become a podcaster with HPR. I would start with an e-mail introduction (as a courtesy) to admin@HackerPublicRadio.org. Next, record you audio. When you have a file ready to upload, select an open slot in the calendar page and follow the instructions, be prepared to paste in your shownotes. 

F. I also credit HPR for getting me my first invite to participate in my first podcast with multiple hosts. Once a month, Hacker Public Radio records a Community News podcast, recorded on the first Saturday afternoon after the end of the previous month (exact times and server details are published in the newsletter). All HPR hosts, and indeed listeners are invited to participate, it is just asked that you have listened to most the the past month's shows so you can participate in the discussion. 

I. Like most multi-host audio podcast's, HPR uses Mumble to record shows, including the annual New Year's Eve show, which has dozens of participants. There is a Mumble tutorial on LinuxLUGCast.com to help you get started. 

II. I started to take part in Hacker Public Radio's Community News a few months after recording my first podcast. I did it because I wanted to take a greater part in HPR, not because I considered it an audition, but it is a good way to show other people that you can politely and intelligently participate in a group discussion. (Actually, I have a tendency to wander off into tangents and unintentionally dominate the topic, something I struggle with to this day). 

III. Another way to join in a round table discussion on HPR is to participate in the HPR Book Club. Once a month, we take an audio book that is freely available on the Internet and share our opinions. Recording schedules and the next book to be reviewed are available in the HPR newsletter. 

G. I believe sharing one or more Community News with Patrick Dailey (aka pokey) influenced him to invite me into the cast of Dev Random. The semi weekly Dev Random recorded of the Saturdays Kernel Panic didn't. While we sometimes accidentally talked about tech and open source, we always saved the most disturbing things we'd seen on the Internet in the previous two weeks for discussion on the show, things that could not be discussed on other podcasts. Despite rumors to the contrary, dev random is not dead, only resting, and shall one day rise again to shock and disgust new generations of listeners. 

H. Sometimes you just have to be in the right place at the right time. I won't insult the Kernel Panic Oggcast by calling it a sister show to Dev Random, it just recorded on opposite Saturdays and had some of the same cast members in common. Anyway, I'd been participating in the forum for a while, suggesting topics from FOSS stories I'd come across in social media during the week. I was idling in #oggcastplanet on Freenode when Peter Cross asked for people from the channel to participate in the show on a day only a couple of the regular cast showed up. Dev Random used the same Mumble server, so I used my existing credentials to take Peter up on his offer, and for better or worse I've been a KPO cast member ever since. 

I. While we are on the topic, having a presence on Freenode IRC chat is a great way to get your name or handle known in the podcasting world. Many podcasts have their own channel set up that listeners participate in during live streaming podcasts. Saying something helpful, (or more likely smart alecky) might get you mentioned on the show and make you familiar to the shows audience. I've seen several individuals move from regular forum or chat participants to the hosts of their own show or contributors to HPR. From my own experience, after spending several weeks as silent participants in Podbrewers, listening to the stream and commenting in the chat, RedDwarf and myself were invited to bring our own beers and join the cast. 

I. While many podcasts still have their own IRC channels, other than providing a conduit between the hosts, they are most active during live broadcasts. Between shows, many of the podcasters I listen to gravitate to hanging around in Freenode's #oggcastplanet , since podcasters typically have a chat client open during work and leisure hours. In fact, at KPO we use #oggcastplanet as our primary communications channel during live streaming. 

II. I still recall the day monsterb and Peter64 asked me about the origin of my handle, given it's similarity to their colleague, threethirty. I'd heard both on podcasts I followed, and I felt like I was talking to rock stars. 

III. Now that I am a podcaster in my own right, with a presence in #oggcastplanet, I try to make a point to say hello when I see an unfamiliar handle in the channel. I expect the spambots consider me the nicest guy in IRC. 

IV. As it happens, IRC was also responsible for my involvement in the Linux LUG Cast. LLC was conceived after the re-imaginging and final demise of Steve McLaughlin's project, "Linux Basix". Kevin Wisher, chattr, and honkeymaggo wanted to do a show along the same lines while incorporating the spirit of the unrecorded online LUG that always preceded it on the mumble server. I was brought along by the simple expediency of never having closed the #LinuxBasix channel in my chat client. We have been going for a little more than a year and have attracted a following, but frankly we have not found the listener participation we were looking for. This was meant to be a true online Linux Users Group for people couldn't travel to a LUG. So far, it's usually been the same four of five guys talking about what Linux projects succeed, what failed, and what we we're going to try next. I've learned a lot in the past year, and I expect the listeners have as well, but we are always hoping to get more live participation. Rural areas like the midwest are our target audience. The details of the Mumble connection are posted at LinuxLUGCast.com, we always monitor the Freenode.org IRC channel #linuxlugcast while recording, and the Feedback link is posted on the website. 

Thank you for your time and attention this afternoon, especially considering the caliber of talks running in the other two channels. I can be contacted at FiftyOneFifty@LinuxBasement.com . Are there any questions?

Mailing List Etiquette - Dave Morriss | 2015-04-03


Mailing List Etiquette

Overview

In February 2015 I created a script to add a section to the monthly Community News show notes. The added section summarises the discussions on the HPR mailing list over the previous month. My script processes the messages archived on the Gmane site and reports on the threads it finds there.

In writing this script I noticed the number of times people made errors in replying to existing message threads and initiating new threads on the list. I thought it might be helpful if I explained some of the do's and don'ts of mailing list use to help avoid these errors.

Full Notes

Since the notes explaining this subject are long (the size limit is 4000 characters), they have been placed here: http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1740_full_shownotes.html

Experimental EPUB Notes

For this show I have tried generating an EPUB version of the full notes. This can be found here: http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1740_full_shownotes.epub. Comments on this idea are welcome.

Renovating another Public-Domain Counterpoint Textbook - Jon Kulp | 2015-03-24


I mistakenly referred to episode 1516 while I was speaking. I meant to say 1512. The two musical bumpers I used in the show are by J.S. Bach, examples 90 and 91 in the textbook "Applied Counterpoint," by Percy Goetschius. These are my own MIDI renditions so they have no copyright burden upon them.

Upgrading an old laptop - swift110 | 2015-03-23


In July of 2010 I was given a laptop to repair by one of my friends, I couldn’t figure out what was wrong with it despite hours of trial and error so eventually I got so frustrated with it that I just set it aside and forgot about for a while. Meanwhile my friend got another laptop so he told me I could keep it.

Success With Students - Kevie | 2015-03-11


For his second attempt at a solo episode of HPR, Kevie talks about a very positive experience he had introducing school pupils to podcasting. From this he was able to discuss the benefits of Creative Commons music and using open source, cross platform software. The ultimate success came when three students took the plunge and installed Linux on their own computers. 

Music included in this episode:
•Try by Feixl https://www.jamendo.com/en/track/1203446/try
•Make My Day by Sunburst https://www.jamendo.com/en/track/964586/make-my-day

Cross-compilers Part 2 - Mike Ray | 2015-03-09


In part 1 I described cross-compiling, what it means and why you might want to, or even need to use it. 

I also described how to create a cross-compiler tool-chain using crosstool-ng. 

In this show I will demonstrate using one of the cross-compilers which I created as described in the last show to compile a Raspberry Pi Linux kernel. 

As usual with my shows the show-notes can't be squashed into 4k, so there is an HTML version at:

The Linux Tree Command - JWP | 2015-03-05


tree - list contents of directories in a tree-like format.

Synopsis

tree [-adfghilnopqrstuvxACDFNS] [-L level [-R]] [-H baseHREF] [-T title] [-o filename] [--nolinks] [-P pattern] [-I pattern] [--inodes] [--device] [--noreport] [--dirsfirst] [--version] [--help] [--filelimit #] [directory ...] 

Description

Tree is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth indented listing of files. Color is supported ala dircolors if the LS_COLORS environment variable is set, output is to a tty, and the -C flag is used. With no arguments, tree lists the files in the current directory. When directory arguments are given, tree lists all the files and/or directories found in the given directories each in turn. Upon completion of listing all files/directories found, tree returns the total number of files and/or directories listed. 

By default, when a symbolic link is encountered, the path that the symbolic link refers to is printed after the name of the link in the format: 

name -> real-path 

If the '-l' option is given and the symbolic link refers to an actual directory, then tree will follow the path of the symbolic link as if it were a real directory.

What's in my Crate - Mike Ray | 2015-02-24


Back in the summer of 2014 I started going to the Surrey Linux User Group. 

I was asked to give a short presentation about Linux accessibility and how, although I am totally blind, I still write code and muck about with Linux. 

I was then asked to give the same presentation at the Portsmouth LUG. 

This time I made it more comprehensive and took more kit. 

So I take this opportunity to give my version of the "What's in my bag" shows that some folks have been doing. As I am unemployed, like a lot of blind folks, I have been unable to justify this before now because I don't lug an interesting collection of stuff to and from work. 

Here's a simple bullet list about the crate and it's contents: 
•The crate is a 35 litre capacity 'Really Useful Box' 
•First in were 2 Dell Latitude D630 (64-bit) laptops 
•Next in was a Dell Inspiron (32-bit) laptop, clunky and slow 
•The three laptops were sandwhiched between 3-ply layers of bubble-wrap 
•Next in was a Seika 40-cell refreshable Braille display 
•Next was a clear polycarbonate, zip-up pencil case stuffed with audio leads 
•Then a 'Mesh' Bluetooth and line-in external speaker 
•And a Braun external speaker/FM radio/micro-SD boom-box 
•A four-way mains power splitter 
•The three AC adaptors for the laptops 
•On the top of the box, because it was too wide to go in, was a USB keyboard 
•Mobile phone charging battery 'brick', for the Raspberry Pi 
•A Raspberry Pi, a Banana Pi and some Arduino bits and pieces 

Here's what I demonstrated with two of the laptops: 
•Trisquel Linux and accessibility in the Gnome desktop with Orca 
•Accessibility in the console with Debian and the Braille display on the Inspiron 

The second Latitude was with me so I could get some sighted help with BIOS settings. 

My thanks have to go to Tony Wood for the lift to and from both of these accessibility presentations. I could not have done either, especially the Portsmouth one without his help. 

Thanks also to Lisi, the coordinator of the Portsmouth LUG and to the folks of that LUG for their enthusiasm. 

Here's the link to the HPR show about my Raspberry Pi tts code fix:

Cross-compilers part 1 - Mike Ray | 2015-02-16


Cross-compilers, Part 1 

In this show I'll introduce the concept of cross-compiling software, explain what it is and why you might want/need to do it. 

I'll also talk about a great piece of kit for creating cross-compiler tool-chains on Linux; crosstool-ng. 

As with most of my shows, the show notes are far too long to fit into the restricted size, so there's an HTML version as well, at: 

http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1706/index.html 

Here are some bullet-points: 
•cross-compilers, why and what? 
•crosstool-ng 
•Cross-compiler tool-chain generation gotchas 
•Raspberry Pi cross-compiling tool-chain generation with crosstool-ng 
•Compiling a kernel on a Pi takes 15 hours 
•On my not-so-screaming quad-core Debian machine it takes 15 minutes

•Klaatu: http://hackerpublicradio.org/correspondents.php?hostid=78

Introducing Jeffrey Powers aka Geekazine - daw | 2015-02-12


I was asked to do a followup to my Introduction to the Netizen Empowerment Federation. Specifically, I was asked to talk a bit more about the goals of Sportazine.com and how it fits into free culture. I thought the best way to do that was to introduce my Sportazine.com co-founder, Jeffrey Powers. 

A May 2011 estimate puts the sports industry at 350-450 billion ($480-$620 billion) http://www.atkearney.com/en_GB/paper/-/asset_publisher/dVxv4Hz2h8bS/content/the-sports-market/10192 -- it is inarguably foolish to ignore it. I don't think you are going to convince anyone to change their ways by shouting at them, or quietly being condescending. 

Listen to find out Jeff's answers! 

How has Sportazine changed from your initial vision when we created it almost 5 years ago? 

What is JMP? 

We're recording on Jan 16. What's the tech history bit people should check out on your site for today? 

Do you do interviews for any of your sites? 

How do you vet interviewees? 

What is the best way for someone to get in touch with you if they'd like to be an interviewee? 

Where are you speaking to you today from Jeff? 

What are your favorite sports to watch or play? 

How far do you think the Packers will go this year? We're recording on Jan 16, but there aren't open slots on HPR for a while, so people may get to see if you are right. 

Professional video game players get athletic visas in the US, and are covered by ESPN (http://kotaku.com/some-sports-fans-upset-espn-is-airing-video-game-tourna-1608298005) so I suppose we might as well. How much do you cover video games on your various sites? 

What is the name of your band, and where can people find the band? 

Is there anything else you would like to tell the listeners?

Open Source CD Rippers - Kevie | 2015-02-11


For a first attempt at flying solo for an episode of HPR, Kevie takes a look at a variety of open source CD ripping software. Looking at graphical applications https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/SoundJuicer: Sound Juicer and http://littlesvr.ca/asunder/: Asunder along with the command line tools http://bashburn.dose.se/: Bashburn and http://bach.dynet.com/crip/: Crip. Along with considering if it is worth having a dedicated ripping tool when a fully fledged audio suite https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox/: Rhythmbox and http://www.videolan.org/vlc/: VLC will also allow ripping. Regular listeners to the http://unseenstudio.co.uk/category/tuxjam-ogg/: TuxJam podcast will know that Kevie is a big fan of creative commons music and this episode is no different with the tracks by http://20lb.net/: 20lb Sounds and http://bridgesplosion.bandcamp.com/: Blowing Up Bridges. 

Music included in this episode: 
•http://20lb.bandcamp.com/track/rip-it-up: Rip It Up by 20lb Sounds 
•http://bridgesplosion.bandcamp.com/track/grip-it-and-rip-it: Grip It and Rip It by Blowing Up Bridges

My APOD downloader - Dave Morriss | 2015-01-29


My APOD Downloader

Astronomy Picture of the Day

You have probably heard of the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) site. It has existed since 1995, is provided by NASA and Michigan Technological University (MTU) and is created and managed by Robert Nemiroff and Jerry Bonnell. The FAQ on the site says "The APOD archive contains the largest collection of annotated astronomical images on the internet".

The Downloader

Being a KDE user I quite like a moderate amount of bling, and I particularly like to have a picture on my desktop. I like to rotate my wallpaper pictures every so often, so I want to have a collection of images. To this end I download the APOD on my server every day and make the images available through an NFS-mounted volume.

In 2012 I wrote a Perl script to perform the download, using a fairly primitive HTML parsing method. This script has been improved over the intervening years and now uses the Perl module HTML::TreeBuilder which I believe is much better at parsing HTML.

The version of the script I use myself also includes the Perl module Image::Magick which interfaces to the awesome ImageMagick image manipulation software suite. I use this to annotate the downloaded image with the title parsed from the HTML so I know what it is.

The script I am presenting here is called collect_apod_simple and does not use ImageMagick. I chose to omit it because the installation of this suite and the related Perl module can be difficult. Also, I do not feel that the annotation always works as well as it could, and I have not yet found the time to correct this shortcoming.

A version of the more advanced script (called collect_apod) is available in the same place as collect_apod_simple should you wish to give it a try. Both scripts are available on Gitorious under the link https://gitorious.org/hprmisc/hprmisc.

The Code

The script itself is described in the full show notes, available here: http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1694_full_shownotes.html

Some useful tools when compiling software - Rho`n | 2015-01-21


introduction

Hi this is Rho`n and welcome to my first submission to Hacker Public Radio. I have been working on an application using the Python programming language with the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) libraries for the GUI interface. After acquiring a new laptop and installing a fresh copy of Ubuntu on it, I decided to set up the build environment I needed to be able to work on my project. I have been building from source the EFL libraries along with the Python-EFL wrapper libraries. For the last couple machines on which I have built the software, I would use the standard configure, make, and make install procedure. This time around I decided to create a debian package to use for installing the libraries. It had been a few years since I had created a .deb, so I googled for some tutorials, and found mention of the checkinstall program. After reading a couple blog posts about it I decided to try it out. checkinstall is run instead of "make install" , and will create a .deb file, and then install the newly created package. 

cut and tr commands

To help speed up the configure process, I had previously created a file from my other builds that is a grep of my history for all the various "apt get install" commands of the libraries the EFL software needs to compile. Since my current operating system was a freshly installed distribution of Ubuntu, I needed to install the build-essential package first. After looking through my install file, and I decided to create a single apt-get install line with all the packages listed, instead of running each of the installs seperately. I knew I could grep the file, and then pass that to awk or sed, but my skill with either isn't that great. I did a little searching to see what other tools were out there and found the cut command and the tr command. Cut lets you print part of a line. You can extract set a field delimeter with the -d option and then list a range of fields to be printed with the -f option. The tr command can replace a character. I used this to replace the new line character that was printed by the cut command to generate a single line of packages which I piped to a file. A quick edit of the file to add "sudo apt-get install" at the beginning, add execute permissions to the file, and now I have a nice, easy way to install all the needed libraries. 
•https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15580144/concatenate-many-lines-of-output-to-one-line 
•https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7857090/awk-extract-specific-columns-from-delimited-file 

apt-file and checkinstall

At least that was the idea. After installing the libraries, and running configure, I still received errors that libraries were missing. The machines from which my list of libraries was generated, had all been used for various development purposes, so some needed libraries were already installed on them, and so their installation had passed out of my history. Besides echoing to standard out the file configure can't find, it also creates a log file: config.log. Between the two it is relatively easy to figure out what library is needed. Often the libraries needed included their name in the .deb which has to be installed, and finding them is easy with an apt-cache search and grep of the library name. The hardest ones to find were often the X11 based references. In this case, I needed the scrnsaver.h header file. After googling, I found a reference to the needed package (libxss-dev) on Stack Exchange. The answer also showed how to use the apt-file command to determine in which package a file is included. I wish I had run into this before, there a few times where it took a number of searches on the internet to figure out which package I needed to install, and "apt-file find" would have saved time and frustration. A very handy tool for anyone developing on a debian based distribution. As it turns out, that was the last dependency that needed resolved. After a successful configure, and successful compile using the make command, I was ready to try out checkinstall. Running sudo checkinstall, brings up a series of questions about your package, helping you fill out the needed .deb meta-data. I filled out my name and email, name for the package, short description of the package, and let everything else go to the suggested defaults. After, that hit enter and checkinstall will create a debian package and install it for you. If you run "apt-cache search <name of package>" you will see it listed, and "apt-cache show <name of package>" will give you the details you created for the package. There are warnings on the Ubuntu wiki not to use this method for packages to be included in an archive or in a ppa. It does work great for a local install, and would use it to install on machines on my local network.

•http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/162 
•http://www.falkotimme.com/howtos/checkinstall/ 
•https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall 

conclusion

After a short side trip into development setup, I'm back writing my application on my new laptop. While I am a big fan of binary packages, Debian being the first GNU/Linux distribution I ever used, sometimes you need to dive in and compile software from source. For me running configure, make, make install has been the easiest way to do this, and these days it usually isn't too difficult to get even moderately complex applications and libraries to build. The most tedious part can be resolving all the dependencies. Now, with apt-file in my tool belt, it will be even faster and easier. I will also be using checkinstall for future compiles. I do like being able to use package management tools to install, and un-install software. 

I hope others find these tools useful. I have posted links in the show notes to the pages about cut, tr, apt-file and checkinstall that led me to these tools. If you've made it this far, thanks for listening to my first post to HPR. As Ken Fallon points out, it's not an HPR episode until you have uploaded it to the server. So let those episode ideas flow from your brain, into your favorite recording device, and up to the HPR server. Let's keep HPR active, vibrant, and a part of our lives for years to come.

Introduction to the Netizen Empowerment Federation - daw | 2015-01-13


This is my first HPR release and I'm going to keep it short. If anyone is intertested in hearing more about any of the projects I mention here, I'm happy to do another show. 

First, I just want to say that everything on Netizen Empowerment Federation (NEF) is released under a free culture license, though not all of the music selected by our presenters is free culture. Right now we are blog and podcast focused, but we would like to add digital creators of all types. 
•http://opensourceplayground.org/ I'm doing these sites in the order they were created, though I'm not sure if OSP or Sportazine was created first. Since OSP is the most closely related to HPR, I'm going to start with that. OSP started as a shared hosting gift for new developers. The idea was I could make people accounts on Dreamhost and they could test the latest free software. Since it wasn't a business, I didn't really promote it. It never took off. I had a few people in Wisconsin make accounts, but they barely used them. It's not really important why that idea failed, but eventually it just became a place for me to talk tech. lnxw48 aka lnxwalt is our current systems administrator and occasionally writes pieces for the site. Like all of our sites, we are always looking for contributors! 
•http://sportazine.com/ As far as I'm aware, Sportazine is the only site dedicated to sports and free culture. This means a lot of things. First it means, making sure online sports viewing works in free formats. It also means that there are free software fantasy sports implementations and that sports journalism happens under free culture licenses. Sportazine is a weird beast because we partnered with JMP Enterprise. 
•http://www.musicmanumit.com/ This is a collection of shows about remixable music. The main show features me and Tom of the band Lorenzo's Music. You can find his band on Jamendo, Spotify, Free Music Archive, and I'm sure plenty of other places. 
•http://law.musicmanumit.com/ The Lawcast is on hiatus and when it comes back will likely be less law focused and more just a catchall for more academic and policy-related stuff than we do on the main show. I'll probably talk a lot more about free software on the reboot, because it's not a topic Tom really cares much about. Tom is a GNU/Linux user, but he refuses to use anything but Skype or Hangout for recording the shows. I'll probably have on musicians that we wouldn't otherwise have on and thus a topic of conversation on those shows will be "Why won't you use Skype or Hangout?" I suspect most of the reasons will be free software focused, but they may also be privacy focused (not that they are unrelated). 

•http://punk.musicmanumit.com The punkcast is pretty much what it sounds like it is. Eventually I want to bring it back. Right now though, I need to focus on finding funding, because if I don't, my wife is going to kick me out. I hope this is resolved by the time you hear this. I'm recording on December 19. 
•https://cyberunions.org/ I think Cyberunions.org may have started before any of these, but I put it here due to the start of the Cyberunions podcast, which is currently on hiatus. Stephen now works for the FSF, so you know free software is important to him. I'm not going to say much about the show, because aside from being a one-time guest, I'm not involved in the project. If people want to know more about Cyberunions, I suggest you pester Stephen (aka mv) about doing a show. 
•http://rynothebearded.com/ RTB really refers to two music shows, one called OO (pronounced "oh-oh") and one called Unformatted. The site also has a stream that carriers a variety of shows, including Cerebral Mix, Rage and Frustration, and the last NEF show I am going to discuss. 
•http://www.amateurzen.us/ Unlike Ryno, you can find the DJ for this show on GNU Social. Alex is https://loadaverage.org/lrockhq . Another CC Music show.

Systemd for Learner Drivers - Steve Smethurst | 2014-12-30


systemd For Learner Drivers

A graphic to help out: http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr1672.svg

This is a subject that attracts controversy, but I am not today going to be controversial, I hope. Many Linux systems are moving away from SysV Init and adopting systemd instead; both Linuxes that I use, Fedora and Mint have adopted systemd, and I understand that Debian has now forked to allow both sides of the argument to have their way. I am not going to get into the debate here. My personal stance is that I see both sides of the argument and I will continue to perch on top of the fence until systemd either proves itself or fails to do so.

In this HPR I am going to try to fill a gap that I have seen in the systemd discussion; that is - how to operate it. I am not an expert on systemd, I have just tried to work it, and in doing so I have fished around in my file system and in the documentation. If you want to know what I found, then keep on listening. By way of opening I will remind myself, and you also, what systemd is replacing.

SysV initd works with runlevels, the most common being
•5 for graphical multiuser networked
•3 for cli multiuser networked
•1 for single user
•6 for reboot
•0 for halt

In moving to a runlevel, unwanted services are shut down and wanted services are started up. For most users on most systems the most appropriate default runlevel is 5 giving multiuser, GUI & networking. Services can be started and stopped on demand by inetd.

systemd works differently. It has target units. For most users on most systems the most appropriate default target is the graphical.target, which does a similar thing to runlevel 5 . Units are configured by unit configuration files. These files may start other units and stop other units. They can impose sequence and dependancies. There is a lot of cascading going on, with unit launching unit launching unit. Units also can be started and stopped on demand by systemd.

Units

The term Unit refers to a resource that systemd is taking under its control. There are 12 different types of Unit.
systemd.servicethat starts/stops daemonssystemd.socketactivates network connectionssystemd.deviceactivates kernel devicessystemd.mountcontrols mount pointssystemd.automountprovides on-demand mounting of file systemssystemd.swapdoes for swap what systemd.mount does for filesystemssystemd.scopestarts/stops external processessystemd.targetgroups of services akin to init level 3, init level 5systemd.snapshotsaves/restores the momentary state of other unitssystemd.timertriggers units based on date/timesystemd.pathtrigger units based on changes in file system objectsorganises units in a hierarchical tree of cgroups, for resource management purposes
Units files called by systemd live in /etc/systemd/system. But these are symbolic links to the real ones stored in /usr/lib/systemd/system

There is a parallel /etc/systemd/user structure which does not seem to do anything on my computers, so I work for now like its not there.

There is also a /run/systemd/system structure which appears to contain runtime configuration files with names like session-xxxx.scope. These are the unit type for external processes.

Table 1. Directory structure for systemd


Path

Description

/etc/systemd/system Local configuration 
/etc/systemd/user User configuration 
/run/systemd/system Runtime units 
/usr/lib/systemd/system Units of installed packages 

Directives

The next thing we need is Directives.

The unit configuration files contain directives to start/stop a unit, and directives that cascade to other unit configuration files that start/stop dependant units. Directives may impose conditions on whether or when to call a unit. There are a whole bunch of different directives listed in man systemd.unit. These are a few.
•Requires= list of units to start. If any required units fail then abort this one
•Conflicts= list of units to stop
•After= the order in which units will start
•Before= the order in which units will start
•Wants= list of units to start. If any fail just continue anyway

As well wanted units listed by the WANTS directive, there may also be a 'wants' directory below the unit directory. So the unit conf file /etc/systemd/system/default.target will cause two further unit conf files to be read in from the /etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/ directory.

Each required unit and wanted unit from the directives, as well as those in the wants directory are added to a job queue. If directives cascade to other unit files containing more directives then all of these dependences are also added to the job queue. A directive may start or stop another unit, or that change the detail of a job already in the queue. All directives ultimately cascade down to starting or stopping one of the base units in /usr/lib/systemd/system.

To get a feel for how this all pans out in practice I will walk us through the cascade of unit files from bootup.

From Bootup

First, the default.taget is activated, which on my system is just a link to graphical.target

graphical.target
[Unit]
Description=Graphical Interface
Documentation=man:systemd.special(7)
Requires=multi-user.target
After=multi-user.target
Conflicts=rescue.target
Wants=display-manager.service
AllowIsolate=yes


Cascades to
•start multi-user.target
•start display-manager.service
•stop rescue.target

Also we have a wants directory /etc/systemd/system/graphical.target.wants/ that
•starts accounts-daemon.service (for logging)
•starts rtkit-daemon.service (for realtime scheduling)

multi-user.target

graphical target cascaded to multi-user.target.
[Unit]
Description=Multi-User System
Documentation=man:systemd.special(7)
Requires=basic.target
Conflicts=rescue.service rescue.target
After=basic.target rescue.service rescue.target
AllowIsolate=yes


Cascades to
•start basic.target
•stop rescue.service
•stop rescue.target (again)

Also we have a wants directory /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ that
- abrt-ccpp.service
- abrtd.service
- abrt-oops.service
- abrt-vmcore.service
- abrt-xorg.service
- atd.service
- auditd.service
- avahi-daemon.service
- chronyd.service
- crond.service
- cups.path
- irqbalance.service
- libvirtd.service
- mcelog.service
- mdmonitor.service
- NetworkManager.service
- nfs.target
- remote-fs.target
- rngd.service
- rpcbind.service
- rsyslog.service
- smartd.service
- vmtoolsd.service


display-manager.service

graphical.target also cascaded to display-manager.service which is not present on F20 so I guess we don't need it.

basic.target

So multiuser.target cascaded to basic.target, which itself cascades to
- sysinit.target
- sockets.target
- timers.target
- paths.target
- slices.target
- firewalld.service


sysinit.target

basic.target cascaded to sysinit.target which itself cascades to
- local-fs.target 
- swap.target
- dmraid-activation.service
- iscsi.service
- lvm2-monitor.service
- multipathd.service ( which looks like all the file system daemons)


sockets.target

basic.target also cascaded to sockets.target which itself cascades to
- avahi-daemon.socket
- cups.socket
- dm-event.socket
- iscsid.socket
- iscsiuio.socket
- lvm2-lvmetad.socket
- rpcbind.socket


End point

Now we start reaching the end-points of this trail at
- systemd.sockets
- systemd.timer
- systemd.path
- systemd.slice
- systemd-fstab-generator


By the time all of that has finished, if I type the command

# systemctl list-units --type service

I see that 58 services are listed as running

Running and Configuring Services

If we are going to work with systemd we will have to give it instructions. In systemd parlance
•active = running, currently in use
•loaded = enabled, available for use

These terms crop up in the output from commands

Many instructions are given to systemd by the systemctl command.

Now to compare line up some common SysV init tasks with their systemd equivalent

Table 2. SysV init commands and their systemd equivalents


command

SysV Init

systemd

Check status # service bluetooth status # systemctl status bluetooth 
Start # service bluetooth start # systemctl start bluetooth 
Stop # service bluetooth stop # systemctl stop bluetooth 
Enable # chkconfig --level 35 ntpd on # systemctl enable ntpd 
Disable # chkconfig --level 35 ntpd off # systemctl disable ntpd 

Journalctl Logging

Much has been said about the desirability or otherwise of binary logs, but systemd gives us these so we had better know what to do with them.

Journal instructions are given to systemd by the journalctl command
To view all log entries in one go. This is verbose, mine came out at ~9000 lines# journalctlTo view from a specific date# journalctl --since="2014-05-07"To view kernel logs# journalctl -kTo follow a log in realtime ... and then to close# journalctl -f
 ...
 # ctl-cTo view log entries associated with a given PID# journalctl _PID=1To view log entries associated with a given service# journatlctl -u bluetooth
Interrogating the system

More systemd information
Get/Set system information. Works like uname, but is more verbose# hostnamectlGet/Set timezone & timedate info# timedatectl
Table 3. SysV init information and their systemd equivalents


SysV Init Info

SysV Init command

systemd info

systemd command

What services are available for init.d to manage # ls /etc/init.d What service units are available for systemd to run # systemctl list-units --type service --all 
What services are configured to be run by init.d for each run level # chkconfig --list What service units are currently active # systemctl list-units --type service

How to start a Blog - Rill | 2014-12-23


So you want to start a blog? 

Here are some of the tings to think about: 
•Why do you want to do a blog? 
•What do you want to say? 
•Who are your audience? 
•Do you mean to promote the blog to a wider audience or do you just want to write? 

There are a number of popular and well known blogging engines and services, these are just some of them: 
•Wordpress: http://wordpress.com/ 
•Drupal: https://www.drupal.org/ 
•Livejournal: http://www.livejournal.com/ 

Nikola is an excellent system for creating a web-site that includes both static pages and a blog. It has been covered before on HPR and it was that show that started me using it.

Trying out Slackware - beni | 2014-12-12


mcnalu wrote a article about Slackware in Linux Voice, Issue 6. 
tux smokes a pipe with the hpr logo 
http://www.linuxvoice.com/issue-6/ 

Beni read this article which lead to him trying out Slackware and being very impressed by its simplicity. 

That's why he asked mcnalu to do a HPR episode about Slackware, which is probably the oldest Linux Distro that's still around and whose developer follows a no-nonsense strategy and is very conservative when it comes switching to new stuff that comes up in the Linux world (like PAM or systemd) 

The distro is one of the if not the most Unix-like Linux distro. It uses a BSD style init system instead of widely used sysvinit. 

Beni and mcnalu talk about the installation process, finding dokumentation and why the website is outdated. 

Further they discuss the package manager and what it means that it doesn't resolve dependencies. They also explain why this isn't necessariliy a bad thing and where to find binary packages. 

In the end they talk about where the Slackware community meets and who is in charge of Slackware. 

http://www.slackware.com/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware 

Slackware documentation isn't as good the BSDs dokumentation or the Arch Wiki. But it's definitely getting better 

http://docs.slackware.com/ 

and there is also 'Slackware essentials', a book that's also available online: 

http://www.slackware.com/book/ 

The Slackware forum on Linux Questions is pretty much the official Slackware forum: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/ 

mcnalu announced his Article in the Linux Questions forum: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/linux-voice-issue-6-a-4175513762/ 

To support the development of Slackware you could buy yourself a Christmas present from the Slackware store:

Command Line Tips: using CTRL + Left / Right arrow will allow you to move through a long command word by word instead of moving through each letter. makes making adjustments to a long command much quicker use the "cd -" to move back and forth between previous directories. cd into a directory, then cd into a different on. Now do "cd -" and you will be back to the first directory.

My audio player collection - Dave Morriss | 2014-12-08


My Audio Player Collection

I got broadband installed in my house in 2005 after I'd bought my first PC. I'd owned a lot of PCs before that, but they had all been cast-offs from the university I was working at, and I accessed the Internet via dial-up to my work.

This was around the time I got sick of listening to the radio and first discovered podcasts, and so I decided I wanted a portable audio player (or MP3 Player as they tended to be called back then).

Since then I have been listening to podcasts pretty much all of the time and have worked my way through a number of players. I thought it might be interesting if I chronicled the devices I have owned in the past 9-10 years.

Using AS numbers to identify where you are on the Internet - Ken Fallon | 2014-12-04


I have a laptop and I want it to use different configurations depending on where I am. If I’m on wifi at home, I don’t want my NAS mounted, but if I’m on a wired connection I do. If I’m at work I want to connect to various servers there. If I’m in the train I want to setup a vpn tunnel. You get the idea. 

My solution to this was to approach it from the laptop and go out. So to look around and see what network I was on. There are a few ways to approach this, you could look at your IP address, the arp tables, try and ping a known server in each location. The issue with looking at an IP address is that most networks use Private Networks. Very soon you will find that the wifi coffee shop happens to have picked the same range as you use at home and now your laptop is trying to backup to their cash register. 

Then I was thinking that I’m approaching this problem from the wrong angle. Why not start with my public IP address range, which has to be unique, and work back from there to my laptop. From there I was planning on maintaining a look-up table of public IP addresses, along the lines of the GeoIP tools developed by MaxMind. 

By Accident I found out that geoiplookup supports AS Number 

From WikiPedia: Autonomous System (Internet)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_System_%28Internet%29
 ISP must have an officially registered autonomous system number (ASN). A unique ASN is allocated to each AS for use in BGP routing. AS numbers are important because the ASN uniquely identifies each network on the Internet. 

So what that is saying is that every network in the Inter(connected)Net(work), must have it’s own unique AS Number. From there I was able to write a script to easily manage my laptops behaviour based on both location and connection type

See http://kenfallon.com/scripts-based-on-your-network-location/ for the complete article and scripts.

Ruth Suehle at Ohio Linux Fest 2014 - Ahuka | 2014-12-03


Ruth Suehle gave the next-to-last keynote at Ohio LinuxFest 2014 on 2014-10-25. In this talk she discusses the significance of open hardware and maker culture, and how this is something we all should participate in. Maker culture is an essential part of the free and open culture we belive in when we talk about open source. And we need to be vigilant to protect our values in the hardware space. As an example she tells us about Bre Pettis and Makerbot, which at one time were very open, but have turned aginst this value as they became more successful. In the final analysis, it is up to us to protect open hardware by voting with our dollars/euros/whatever.

GeekSpeak 2013-06-01 - Various Creative Commons Works | 2014-12-02


As part of Hacker Public Radio's continuing effort to showcase Creative Commons Works, we are proud to present GeekSpeak. GeekSpeak is produced as a radio show for community based station KUSP in Monterey CA, and rebroadcast as podcast, available from GeekSpeak.org. It is a generally a lighthearted and humorous general technology news show, with topics including electronics, computing, robotics, and green tech. Often guest speakers and authors from the technology world will come on for interviews. The shows are just about an hour long.

The regular hosts are Bonnie Jean Primbsch, Lyle Troxell, Miles Elam, and Ben Jaffe (see GeekSpeak.org/geeks/for the full roster). You can often hear them thanking the "Puppetmaster" for letting them continue to use the name GeekSpeak. After broadcasting for several years, it was discovered the term "GeekSpeak" had been registered as a service mark by David Lawrence for a podcast of his own. You might remember Lawrence as the actor who played the character on "Heroes" with the telekinetic ability to physically manipulate other characters against their will.

GeekSpeak has a long standing tradition of using Devo's "Through Bein' Cool" as intro music, so only those episodes that employ user contributed music instead are actually released Creative Commons. What you are about to hear, from the 1st of June of 2013, is just such an episode.

Links
•GeekSpeak.org
•www.kusp.org
•http://www.thedavidlawrenceshow.com/
•http://7thavenueproject.com/ - This is another KUSP show, often dealing with sciencetific topics. I mention it here, because I originally wanted feature a GeekSpeak that I had found fascinating, even though it featured none of the regular hosts : http://geekspeak.org/shows/audio/GeekSpeak_2012-11-24.mp3?1354389765 "Hany Farid, Digital Image Detective with Robert Pollie of The 7th Avenue Project" Basically, Farid talked about the methods he uses to determine whether a digital image has been altered. Ultimately, since it was a re-broadcast of an earlier "7th Avenue Project", and not knowing the original licensing, I decided to bring you a more traditional and recent sample of GeekSpeak.

Raspberry Pi Accessibility Breakthrough - Mike Ray | 2014-11-27


Since April last year the text-to-speech using eSpeak in the Raspberry Pi console has stuttered very badly and regularly crashes the kernel. 

Here's how I fixed it. 

Cloning my github repo: 
git clone https://github.com/cromarty/ttsprojects.git


Installation: 
cd ttsprojects/raspberry-pi/libilctts/build
sudo ./build.sh
cd ../../piespeakup
sudo ./build.sh


Bingo! Speech should work. 

This has only just been released and there is still work to do on the documentation. 

Note: I am not connected to the Raspberry Pi Foundation in any way and anything I say or do is not endorsed by them. 

My email address is connected with a Freelists email list I set up and an accompanying web site: 

http://www.raspberryvi.org/ 

The 'VI' is for 'Visually Impaired' and I DID check with the Foundation about the similarity of the web address before I created it. 

To join our email list send an email to: 

raspberry-vi-request@freelists.org 

With 'subscribe' in the subject.

Unison Syncing Utility - FiftyOneFifty | 2014-11-19


Unison is a file syncing/backup utility, similar to SyncBack on Windows, available in most repros.
1.The graphical interface requires the installation of unison, and unison-gtk.. Unison may be installed w/o the graphical component, but all operations must be initiated from a system running the GUI. ◦Network backups require RSH or SSH to be installed on both machines

2.The standard wisdom seems to be the rsync does not do a true 2 way sync, i.e., to sync to the newest file version going both ways you would have to do rsync ~/LocalFolder you@server:/home/you/RemoteFolder then turn around and do rsync you@server:/home/you/RemoteFolder ~/LocalFolder. Add that to the fact that like cp, or scp, rsync requires separate commands for files with extensions, files without, and hidden files, creating a bash script for syncing files is more complex than creating a Unison profile.
3.Step One: If, like me you are syncing only Documents, make your subfolder structure the same on both machines, ergo, if one PC has /home/you/Documents/recipe and second PC has /home/you/Documents/Recipes, edit your folder structure to be the same on both PCs to avoid duplicate files and folders
4.Launch Unison and create a backup profile First use, create a profile
◦Name of profile

◦Synchronization kind (Local, SSH, RSH, TCP)

◦"First" Directory (you can browse your mounted volumes)

◦"Second" Directory, if you chose Local

◦Host Machine Name (or IP Address)

◦User Name (If you haven't registered SSH keys, you will be prompted for a password on every synchronization.

◦Check whether you want to use compression, (on fast networks or slow processors, compression may create more overhead than it's worth).

◦Target directory (If it's on a remote server, you will need to type the full path, there is no browsing to the folder.)

◦Tell Unison if either folder uses FAT (say an un-reformatted USB stick)
◦If you are backing up to another system, Unison needs to be installed on both. If you are backing up to a server with no GUI desktop manager, you can install just the unison package without unison-gtk, but all the syncs will have to be initiated from the machine with a GUI. (Of course, if you back up to a remote volume that is mounted locally, it should be completely transparent to Unison). If you choose to sync via ssh (recommended), you will need ssh and ssh-server installed appropriately on each machine.

5.Select and run your profile. ◦The first time, expect to get a warning that no archive files (index files that speed up the synchronization scan) were found. They will be created on the first sync.
◦Unison will look for differences between the files in the two selected directories. The differences will be displayed graphically, with arrows pointing left or right, indicating which directory contains the most current version of the file (by modification date). You can choose to merge files either left or right (a conventional backup), do a merge (i.e., Unison itself decides how to combine data from files with the same name (obviously, that could be messy), or to do a sync (ergo, the most current version of a file overwrites older version, regardless of location). Click "Go" to do a true sync.

Surviving A Roadtrip: Food - Windigo | 2014-11-12


As we are all human to some degree, we require sustenance. When on a roadtrip, this can prove to be challenging - but it is also an opportunity to save money and enjoy yourself!
Bringing Food
---

- Buying all your food on the road is a good way to empty your pockets
- Convenience stores do not have your health in mind; their food is generally
  over-salty or over-sugary
- Stopping for snacks can add lots of extra time to a trip
- A quick stop at the grocery store before your trip is not a bad idea
        - Stock up on non-perishable snacks
        - Nuts and trail mix are a classic for a reason. They're full of protein and
          fiber, and easy to munch on in a vehicle
        - Fruit are sweet, healthy, and also usually easy to eat in a vehicle.
          Apples and grapes are super easy, bananas less so, and oranges are tricky.
          You can pre-peel fruit to make it more accessible, but it won't last as long.
- Water is important. Make sure to have a gallon jug with you, and refill as
  necessary. I don't mind tap water, but if you're picky, there are water
  filters designed for camping that are compact and quick. Keep yourself
  hydrated!
- Your options for variety of food increase a lot with a cooler
        - Things like cheese and sandwich meats should do fine
        - Make sure to fill it with ice or freezer packs when you set out in the
          morning, and maybe during the afternoon depending on weather
        - Check to see if your lodgings have refrigeration; your cooler will be
          useless if you don't have something more substantial to use in-between
          legs of your journey.
  

Stopping To Eat
---

- Saving money and being efficient is all well and good, but roadtrips are not
  all about getting from point A to point B.
- A great way to experience an area is by ingesting a small part of it
- Add an hour or two to your travel time for a meal stop
- Pick lunch or dinner
        - Lunch may suit your timetable better if you are an early riser
        - Lunch menus often offer slightly less food for a reduced price
        - Restaurants may be less crowded for lunches
        - Dinner might be a better choice if you like waking and driving late
        - Dinner menus are more comprehensive, but often more on the expensive side
- Avoid chain restaurants all the time, but especially on a roadtrip
- Local restaurants and eateries are usually found in downtown areas, away from
  highways. They are well worth the diversion.
- Different areas have vastly different cuisines, and trying new things can be
  very rewarding. Crawfish: who knew?
- Find something on the menu that you don't recognize, and eat it.
- If you are a picky eater, try not to let your preconceptions stop you from
  trying something. For instance, coconut soup is surprisingly unlike any other
  coconut dishes that I've had.
- Be polite, be patient. Many tourists are rude, and there is a chance that
  the person helping you gets to deal with those tourists frequently.
- Do not be afraid to ask questions. Figure out what you can, but ask for
  clarification if something on the menu is unusual.
- If you have food-based allergies or special dietary requirements, these might
  not be accommodated in all areas. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, or are 
  allergic to gluten, peanuts, or dairy, your options may change drastically
  depending on the region you are in.
  - A little research into local restaurants  could help you determine which
        places you can eat without stopping at each restaurant in town.
- Overall, try to enjoy yourself. Roadtrips can be high-stress affairs, and a
  meal break can do wonders to relieve some of the stress that's built up over
  the day. Relax, and give yourself plenty of time to eat

How I make coffee - Dave Morriss | 2014-11-10


My Coffee History

I'm a coffee lover. I have tried many ways of making coffee.

When I was a child my parents made their coffee in a percolator on the stove top. I remember how great it smelled though it tasted awful to me at that age.

I have owned a variety of filter machines over the years, and these have also been available at the places I have worked. They seemed to do a reasonable job, but nothing special.

One time I owned an all-glass Cona coffee maker, which was very fancy and expensive. It was too fragile for me and eventually met its end while being washed. I don't recall it making particularly wonderful coffee, but it would also make tea, which was a novelty.

I made a number of visits to Indonesia several years ago. There are a lot of pretty good coffee beans available there but the way of making a cup of coffee is not really to my taste. A good dollop of ground coffee in a large cup with boiling water added and large quantities of sugar. Straining those coffee grounds out through your teeth is not a pleasant experience.

As the fashion for the Cafetiere or French Press developed I acquired a number of these. Until recently these were all glass. I found I invariably broke them either by being over zealous when pressing down the plunger or being clumsy when washing them up. It's not a bad way of making coffee, but I have an alternative that I much prefer - the Moka Pot.

Moka Pot

A few years ago I bought a Bialetti Moka Pot. I had never heard of these before, but my son, another avid coffee drinker, pointed me to them. I bought a three-cup pot to start with. This is a small pot; the three refers to three 50ml espresso cups. I also bought a 9-cup pot which is much bigger.

My Bialetti 3-cup and 9-cup pots
 Picture: My Bialetti 3-cup and 9-cup pots

The pot consists of three main elements: a base which holds the water, a funnel which holds the ground coffee and the top which holds the coffee once made. There is a gasket and a metal filter on the underside of the top part to prevent coffee grounds entering.

A disassembled Bialetti
 Picture: A disassembled Bialetti

The Bialetti is heated on a gas or electric stove and forces boiling water through ground coffee under steam pressure. It makes coffee similar to but not the same as espresso coffee.

The base is filled with water just under the level of the pressure release valve.

Bialetti filled with water
 Picture: Bialetti filled with water

I use Italian coffee for the Bialetti since it seems to taste better than any others I have tried.

My current favourite coffee

Once opened I keep my coffee in a vacuum container.

The funnel is placed into the water-filled base.

 Picture: Bialetti ready for coffee

The funnel takes about two scoops of coffee

The pot is placed on the stove. I have a gas stove and so I use a trivet for stability. I have to take care that the gas flame is not too high or the handle will melt, as has happened in the past!

Bialetti in action
 Picture: Bialetti in action

You need to listen out for the bubbling sound the pot makes when the water has passed through the coffe into the top compartment. Letting the remaining steam pass through will over-heat the coffee which you do not want to happen.

Coffee is brewed
 Picture: Coffee is brewed

I make a cup of coffee consisting of one part coffee, one part cold milk and one part boiling water. This makes a large cup of pretty strong yet very smooth coffee which helps to wake me up each morning.

A comforting brew in the wrong cup!
 Picture: A comforting brew - in the wrong cup!

The Bialetti usually gets one use per day, after which it is washed up. Some purists say that it should only be rinsed out so that the coffee residues on the inside are not removed. I have not noticed any difference personally.

Bare Metal Programming on the Raspberry Pi (Part 2) - Gabriel Evenfire | 2014-10-31


The second episode in a series on bare metal programming on the Raspberry Pi. This episode builds on part 1 by showing how interrupts work on the RPIs ARM chip and the framework I created to manage them. It then goes on to describe how an interrupt-enabled serial driver works. From there, the episode shows how we can use the serial cable in conjunction with a loader program to enable us to load bare-metal programs onto the RPI without having to copy them to the SD card each time. In the process, the episode describes the XMODEM protocol that the loader users for the file transfer process. 

Here is some of the source material that I used while working on this little learning experience.

Banana Pi - First Impressions - Mike Ray | 2014-10-30


The Banana Pi - First Impressions

They say duplication is the sincerest form of flattery, substitute the word of your choice for 'duplication'.

The Banana Pi is made in China and bears an uncanny resemblance to the Raspberry Pi.

Not just the name, the board is fractionally larger, some of the features on the board are similarly placed:
•26-pin GPIO
•3.5mm analogue audio jack
•RCA composite video jack
•SD card slot

There are things the RPI does not have:
•Power button
•uBoot button
•Microphone
•USB-otg port (otg = on-the-go, a bi-directional USB port)
•SATA connector

The processor is a dual-core running slightly faster than the Raspberry Pi, although to be fair, of course, the RPI can be over-clocked.

The Banana Pi has twice the RAM and a dual-core processor.

The SoC is the ARM Allwinner A20.

Getting my Hands on a Banana Pi

My first Banana dropped through the letterbox a couple of days ago.

Thanks to some kind soul on the Raspberry Pi Facebook group who described the connectors on the edges of the board I narrowly avoided plugging the power supply into the USB-otg port. The power micro-USB is on the underside of the board between the SATA power and data connectors which are on the upper side of the board.

Can't really say much about it because I can't actually see the build quality, but it feels nice. The PCB is fractionally thinner than the RPI.

Problems

I had an initial struggle to find a download link for any images.

The downloads page of lemaker.org has a two row table on it which appears to be upside-down and it has links to Google-drive, two different public DropBox links, a MS One-Drive link, and something I didn't initially find, an FTP link.

Both of the DB links are duff because they have suspended the account because of excessive traffic.

This is the FTP download link:
http://filez.zoobab.com/bananapi/mirror/

Available Images

When I found the FTP page I grabbed images for:
•Arch Linux
•Bananian-latest
•Lubuntu
•Raspbian

I downloaded and extracted all of these images to my Debian desktop machine and tried to write and boot them in succession.

The first I tried was Arch, on the assumption that would not have a desktop installed.

After writing the card I looked at it on my Debian machine with parted and it appeared to have two partitions. As with the Raspberry Pi there is a small FAT16 partition and a bigger ext4 partition.

The FAT partition contained the same files as the Raspberry Pi:
•config.txt
•cmdline.txt
•kernel.img

And some others I can't remember.

In addition it contained:
•uEnv.txt
•uImage

It appears uEnv.txt is equivalent to the Raspberry Pi cmdline.txt file, and uImage is, of course, the kernel.

So oddly it has the files for the RPI and it's own in the FAT partition.

Then I tried Bananian, and this appears to be Debian Wheazy for ARM.

Similar story with the FAT partition.

It is a very minimal installation which has little more than the Linux Standard Base (LSB) packages. I like this because I like to have control.

Sound and Stuff

I found a review from April this year that said the sound driver snd-bcm2835 was not available. At the name snd-bcm2835 my heart sank because I expected the BPI to have the same stuttering text-to-speech problems as the RPI.

Not expecting much I did, as root:
apt-get install alsa-base alsa-utils

Looking through /lib/modules/... blah blah I found a driver called:
snd-aaci.ko

I did:
modprobe snd-aaci

And then:
speaker-test

And I got pink noise!

Next I did:
apt-get install espeakup
update-rc.d espeakup defaults
modprobe speakup_soft

And speakup burst into life with no stuttering!

Immediate Conclusions

The online community and code-base for the Banana Pi is not yet very mature, and because the origin of the beast is China, a lot of what's out there is in Chinese.

But it is growing. And after all, it took the RPI a while to take off and go ballistic.

At the moment I would say the Banana Pi is not for the faint-hearted or the total newbie, although, a lot of newbie questions are generic and don't have machine-specific answers.

LeMaker page:

The worst thing about the Banana Pi is, when writing emails about it, and these show-notes, typing the word 'banana' and knowing when to stop!

Penguicon 2015 Call for Talks - Ahuka | 2014-10-23


I am the coordinator for the Tech Track at Penguicon 2015, which is a combined FOSS/Science Fiction convention held every spring in the Metro-Detroit area. The 2015 event will happen April 24-26 at the Westin Hotel in Southfield, MI. The theme for the upcoming year's event is Biotechnology and medicine, looking at how technology is affecting our health and life. But we want a lot of different talks as well, so I will be happy to accept proposals that look at things like cloud computing, security, hardware hacks, and anything else that would be of interest to geeks and hackers.

Klaatu talks about how to get to VNC up and running. It focuses on x11vnc but basically it applies to any variety.

Virtual Network Computing
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

 In computing, Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other direction, over a network.
 VNC is platform-independent – There are clients and servers for many GUI-based operating systems and for Java. Multiple clients may connect to a VNC server at the same time. Popular uses for this technology include remote technical support and accessing files on one's work computer from one's home computer, or vice versa.
 VNC was originally developed at the Olivetti & Oracle Research Lab in Cambridge, United Kingdom. The original VNC source code and many modern derivatives are open source under the GNU General Public License.
 There are a number of variants of VNC which offer their own particular functionality; e.g., some optimised for Microsoft Windows, or offering file transfer (not part of VNC proper), etc. Many are compatible (without their added features) with VNC proper in the sense that a viewer of one flavour can connect with a server of another; others are based on VNC code but not compatible with standard VNC.
 VNC and RFB are registered trademarks of RealVNC Ltd. in the U.S. and in other countries.

Howto Install LAMP - klaatu | 2014-09-22


If you're just starting out as a web developer or designer, you should know about LAMP and how to use it. This episode introduces you to the basics. 

LAMP (software bundle)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
 LAMP is an acronym for an archetypal model of web service solution stacks, originally consisting of largely interchangeable components: Linux, the Apache HTTP Server, the MySQL relational database management system, and the PHP programming language. As a solution stack, LAMP is suitable for building dynamic web sites and web applications.

Extravehicular Activity - Steve Smethurst | 2014-09-16


EVA - The Rules for Extravehicular Activity

Here I dip into the NASA experience of and rules for Extravehicular Activity, prompted at first by watching a film called The Europa Report, directed by Sebastian Cordero (2013).

WARNING - THIS PODCAST CONTAINS SPOILERS

While I have some gripes about the film, I was impressed by its general failfulness to the science
•It thought to find life on Europa, a moon of Jupiter considered by real exobiologists and planetary scientists to be a good candidate
•Neil deGrasse Tyson made a cameo appearance
•The portrayal of Europa's geography and character
•Having to drill through the ice to get at the sea below
•The behaviour of the crew as scientists and engineers

Science consultant on the film was Kevin Hand, an astrobiologist and expert on Europa at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory

To my mind, the scientists were behaving like scientists and the engineers behaved like engineers. To follow along it might help to recall their names
•Captain - Willam Xu
•Pilot - Rosa Dasque
•Chief scientist - Daniel Luxembourg
•Marine biologist - Katya Petrovna
•Junior engineer - James Corrigan
•Chief engineer - Andrei Blok

All was going scientifically until the director drove the plot forward with two EVA incidents

EVA-1 : Flash back episode, engineers James and Andre go out to fix a failed communications circuit
•Andre rips his suit
•James gets squirted with rocket fuel
•Only one astronaut survives

I have problems with this because it's just too clumsy for trained professional astronauts. Where are the decontamination procedures, the tethers, the special tools?

EVA-2 : Down on the surface, Marine biologist Katya decides to walk out alone
•Tourtured debate in the ship
•Of four able and expendable crew members, none go with her
•Katya does not come back alive

With this I am shouting at the screen "No Way! Where's the fracking operating manual? No one goes EVA on their own"

So, that is why I researched the NASA rules for Extravehicular Activity. And I found that none of these events would have happened the way they were shown, had the crew, who were so professional in every other way, followed the NASA procedures.

The two astronauts issue
•The most recent occasion where an astronaut went solo EVA was in 1971, when David Scott stuck his head out of the airlock of Apollo 15.
•Most recent before that was in 1966, when Buzz Aldrin went EVA from Gemini 12 (Gemini craft only had two crew).
•Since 1971, there have been 358 space walks and every single one has had two crew.
•I found no written regulation, but de-facto, nobody leaves the spacecraft alone.

NASA procedures

NASA documents on the internet discuss in exhaustive detail all considerations for EVA. What I present is a cherry-picked handful. I could not cover all of it
•reasons for EVA
•alternatives
•planning
•hazard mitigation
•procedures for safe conduct
•fall-back procedures
•failure handling
•accident control

International Space Station (ISS) EVA Procedures Checklists
•Presuming that all the equipment maintenance checks, and readiness checks have alread been done ◦30 minutes of Airlock preparation and testing
◦30 minutes of changing components for the suit to fit the astronaut
◦170 minutes of EVA-Prep

•Then you are ready to depressurise and leave the airlock
•EVA might last 2 - 8 hours
•Post EVA ◦30 minute procedure to take the suit off
◦10 minute procedure to disconnect internal equipment
◦Recharge & maintain the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)
◦Clean & maintain the Suit


Although this podcast is about EVA, it does reference the science in a film that I enjoyed and respect very much, so here is a gem that I only came across while researching the landing site. In the scientific journal Nature, Volume 479, 16 November 2011, Britney Schmidt et al, of University of Texas, Austin, published a paper titled "Active formation of 'chaos terrain' over shallow subsurface water on Europa." In the paper these authors suggest that in the Conemara zone of the Chaos Terrain, an area on the surface of Europa, the ice may be as little as 3 km thick. Then in the film the Conemara Chaos was the targetted landing zone and the drill broke through the ice at a depth of 2800m.

Well there is one more thing that the podcast says, but it is the ultimate spoiler. So if you have not already listened to the podcast, I highly recommend that you watch the film first.

Steam and wine with linux - Andrew Conway | 2014-09-11


This isn't about my worshiping of Bacchus by playing games on linux in a sauna (that's for a future show) but instead about getting a Windows-only Steam game to work on a recent 64 bit linux distro. I'm using Slackware, but I suspect the pitfalls and solutions I encountered would be similar on other distros.

Beginner's guide to the night sky 3 - A wee dot on a dark sky - Andrew Conway | 2014-09-02


A ramble about stars, by a geeky chap who resides on planet Earth. This episode is entitled a wee dot on a dark sky. 

I comment briefly on why it's remarkable that the night sky is dark. I then go on to talk about the colour of stars, which we can just perceive with the naked eye. To learn more you need to use a prism, or, as professional astronomers prefer, a diffraction grating to obtain a spectrum of a star. I talk a little too much about the mathematics of diffraction gratings but eventually get back to talking about spectrum of the Sun which in overall shape is very close to what physicists call a black body spectrum (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body)- the spectrum any object will have at a given temperature. Astronomers and physicists prefer to measure temperature in units of kelvin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin), and to convert to it you only need to add 273 to the celsius temperature. Conversion from Fahrenheit is left as an exercise to the listener. 

The Sun shows spectral lines, specifically dark lines on the broad spectrum called absorptions lines. This is caused by atoms in a cooler layer of gas (called the chromosphere) that's just above the bright surface of the Sun (called the photosphere). In fact, Helium is named as such because it was first discovered by its absorption lines in the solar spectrum (Helios is Greek for Sun). Many other elements can be found in the spectrum of the Sun and other stars, but most of the mass of all stars is made up of hydrogen and helium. 

The temperature of a star is correlated with colour, with blue stars being hotter than red stars. This was originally measured by astronomers by something called colour or B-V (B minus V) index. 

The luminosity of a star is the rate at which it emits energy as light, and can be measured in the same units as light bulbs, i.e. watts (W). But to estimate the luminosity we need to know the distance to a star which, for nearby stars, can be found by the parallax method. By plotting colour index (a proxy for temperature) against luminosity we can form a key piece of empirical evidence - the Hertzsprung Russell diagram: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram 

It turns out that our nearest star - the Sun - is quite unremarkable. It is neither very hot or cool, nor very bright or dim - it's a fairly typical star.

Introducing Nikola the Static Web Site and Blog Generator - guitarman | 2014-08-19


Nikola - The Static Web Site and Blog Generator - http://getnikola.com

Note: Please see developer notes below

What is it? A Static Website and Blog Generator based on Python.
 What is a Static Website Generator? It generates posts and pages via commands. You edit those posts and pages in a text editor, then run a command to build the site, and finally, deploy/upload the generated html etc files to your webhost.
 That sounds kinda old school are you sure thats web 3.0? Its old and new school. Nikola gives you CMS like features without the overhead of the database server and page rendering engine.
 How can I install it? Use PIP and follow the handbook on the getnikola.com website. NOTE: Python 2.6 or newer or Python 3.3 or newer is required
sudo pip install nikola
sudo pip install nikola[extras]


You should be good to go if you can enter nikola help in a terminal and get a list of nikola commands.
 Lets create our skeleton website:
nikola init mysite 


You will need to answer some questions now (NOTE a directory to cd into called mysite will be created if you issue mysite.. You should enter your domain name instead - mysite is just an example).
 The questions it asks will help populate the conf.py file in the mysite directory.
Site Title: 
Site Author:
Site Author Email:
Site Description:
Site URL:
Languages to support: (default en)
Time zone: 
Which comments system to use:


Once complete your site will be created and in the directory you named the site as - in my case, mysite.
 cd into that and take a look at the files with ls.
 you will have:
•conf.py - your configuration file
•files - where you will place images etc and reference them in blog posts and pages
•galleries - where you can serve up images in a gallery
•posts - where your blog posts go
•stories - where your pages go

Lets create a blog post.
nikola new_post


Type in the title of your blog post and hit enter. I will use foobar in this example
 It will report the new post is in posts/foobar.rst
 fire up your text editor and edit that file.

There is a header area at the top of the file - most of it is already filled in and you wont need to change it but you should add a Tag because you can see posts by Tag once the site is generated and it gives your readers a way to find all items on that subject. These are separated by commas so enter as many or few as you like. Enter a Description in the Description area.
 Now move into the Write your post here area and go to town - erase that or it shows up in your post.
 You should read the page on ReStructuredText here: http://getnikola.com/quickstart.html but also just look at the source by clicking 'Source' on the getnikola website and you can see the markup they used. Some basics are
*word*

for italics, **word**

for bold, a single * space item for bullet points and for hyperlinks `Tree Brewing Co: <http://treebeer.com/>`_.

a Tree Brewing Co hyperlink which will bring you when clicked to treebeer.com. Lastly issue: .. image:: /files/imagefilename.jpg

to point to an image file that you have placed into the files directory.
 Ok lets say you are done your post, save it and exit. Lets now build your site and fire up the built in webserver to display it. nikola build
nikola serve -b


Your default web browser will launch and you will see your site with blog post. Savour the moment - you have just created your first blog post. Note all the generated files you would upload to your webhost are in the output folder.
 Ok so thats great but I want to add pages and have it in my navigation window Ok lets do that.
nikola new_post -p

Enter a name for it and press Enter. In my case I created MyPage 
It tells you your page is in the stories directory and shows you how it named the file. In my case its mypage.rst
 Open that in a text editor and compose the page - save it when complete.
 So that would be great but its not showing up in your navigation yet. You need to put that in your conf.py file.
 Open conf.py in a text editor, look for NAVIGATION_LINKS. Observe how the existing pages are linked and follow that format. Here is how I would add mypage: (/stories/mypage.html, MyPage), any page you create will show up in stories so dont forget to put that in the path.
NAVIGATION_LINKS = {
    DEFAULT_LANG: (
        ("/archive.html", "Archive"),
        ("/categories/index.html", "Tags"),
        ("/rss.xml", "RSS feed"),
        ("/stories/mypage.html", "MyPage"),
    ),
}


Save that and rebuild your site.
 NOTE:: As of Today Nikola v7.0.1 requires a special command to include the new pages in navigation. This has been fixed in git but currently you must issue:
nikola build -a
nikola serve -b 


Now you are viewing it - nice work - you have a page now.
 This site seems a bit plain, how can I theme it? Glad that you asked - issue this command.
nikola bootswatch_theme -n custom_theme -s slate -p bootstrap3


Now you have set it to use the slate bootswatch theme. Review the bootswatch themes on: http://bootswatch.com/
 In order to let Nikola know to use this new theme you need to edit the conf.py file and look for THEME and change the value from bootstrap3 to custom_theme.
 Now issue these commands at the command line to view the changes:
nikola build
nikola serve -b 


You can modify the themes to your liking and there is guidance on changing the theme on the nikola website.
 There are ways to depoly your site via rsync or ftp commands in the conf.py file. There are also other things you can set in the conf file such as google analytics, add an embeded duckduckgo or google search engine, specify options for the image galleries etc.
 More things you can do to spify up your posts / pages are to do with using shortcode like sytax for ReStructuredText. You can embed soundcloud, youtube videos etc - here is a list of these: http://getnikola.com/handbook.html#restructuredtext-extensions

I hope this helps you get started on using Nikola and hope you enjoy using it as much as I do. If you have questions or comments, find me in the oggcastplanet.net irc chat room on freenode, or go to http://stevebaer.com click Tags and click HPR and leave a comment on this episodes blog post. Until next time, Cheers!

Corrections to this episode provided by Chris Warrick

http://stevebaer.com/posts/hpr-episode-on-using-the-static-web-site-and-blog-generator-called-nikola.html

Some small corrections:
1.it is recommended to use a virtualenv, `sudo pip` can be dangerous
2.`pip install nikola[extras]` is enough, no need to do both steps
3.new pages can be created with `nikola new_page`, too (both ways are equally supported)
4.missing quotes around "MyPage" in example navbar codeFixed
5.you can get rid of /stories/ if you change PAGES[*][1] from "stories" to an empty string.
6.bootswatch themes are not everything, there is also install_theme that uses a more varied collection from http://themes.getnikola.com/

Blather Speech Recognition for Linux - Jon Kulp | 2014-08-06


Blather Speech Recognition for Linux: Jon has a conversation with his computer

In this episode I have a blather conversation with my computer. This is a sort of appendix to an episode I released earlier (hpr 1284 http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1284) which was a conversation with Jezra, the lead developer of the blather speech recognition program for Linux. The current episode will make much more sense if you listen to the previous one first.

For the most part I use blather as an accessibility tool, to manipulate my desktop and generally to save myself hundreds of keystrokes a day. This is important because of my repetitive strain injuries. Blather allows me to do many “productivity” tasks using only my voice. I also like to have fun with it, though, and this “conversation” is an example of the sort of goofy stuff I like to do. When the computer hears me say certain predefined phrases, it runs commands. For example when I say “what’s for dinner,” it shuffles the contents of a plaintext file that has about 20 options for dinner, chooses the top option and pipes it through my default text-to-speech program, which is either espeak or festival, depending on what I set as the environment variable in my blather startup script. When it hears me ask for certain other information, such as “what day is it?” and “what’s today’s date?”, it runs the appropriate system command and pipes the output through the text-to-speech program. For information about blather, the various back-end things that make it work, examples of my blather scripts and configuration files, visit the links below.

Multiboot Partitioning with Linux - Matt McGraw (g33kdad) | 2014-08-05


I like to distro-hop some and try out new things. Sometimes, I want to have 2 or more Linux distros on my system at the same time so I can compare and contrast them. Initially I used a separate /home and mounted it to each distro on my system. This led to config file corruption and I needed a new approach. I hope this will help somebody!

Lunch Breaks - Christopher M. Hobbs | 2014-07-23


Back after a year of HPR silence, I'll talk a little about how I like to spend my lunch breaks and how you can explore your workplace. Put down those tater tots, we're going on an adventure!

In this episode I'll give some information about my lunch history, ways you can maximise your time, gear you'll need to start short stealth/urban exploration, techniques for finding places to explore, and ways to handle being spotted.

If this goes well enough and the audio isn't too garbled, I'll record episodes for the "How I Got Into (GNU) Linux" series.

Here are a few links related to the episode. Note that I link to Amazon and Google. I don't necessarily condone or endorse either service, I just didn't know of any better sources for product information.

Screenplay Writing On Linux and Chromebooks - Thistleweb | 2014-07-21


Writing screenplays for TV or movies is a very precise thing. The industry expects a standardised style and format. ThistleWeb explores a couple of dedicated screenplay writing solutions. Both are dedicated applications that do one job and do it very well. The first is Trelby. It's a GPL cross platform application. It has lots of additional features such as auto completion of character names, summaries and stats.

The second application is a cloud service called Raw Scripts. It's a Chrome extension although I think that's just a link to the site. You log in with a Google or Yahoo account. It's like a dedicated Google Docs web app. It does most of the things Trelby does. It also exports to Google if you want. You can share and collaborate with Raw Scripts. It's hosted on their server, although it's AGPL going forward, so it shouldn't be long before you can host it on your own server.

I've just started to explore screenplay writing as a writing skillset. Both of these applications make the styling and formating incredibly easy, allowing me to concentrate on the actual story.

Agnes is an IT Lawyer - Seetee | 2014-07-01


Today on Hacker Public Radio, we will talk to an IT lawyer about the new EU regulations regarding personal data.

"One thing I think you should be aware of is a principle called 'Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default'!"
 -- Agnes

IT Solutions Expo 2014

In April 2014 I visited the "IT Solutions Expo" at the conference centre known as "The Swedish Fair" in Gothenburg. The tagline of the IT Solutions Expo was "The fair that shows you how to make money on tomorrow's IT solutions".

So a lot of corporate propaganda and sales people. To be totally honest, I hesitated going there. But I am glad I did. There where some really interesting talks concerning privacy and technology that I would not have liked to miss.

Agnes Andersson Hammarstrand, IT Lawyer

The real highlight of the fair was the talk by Agnes Andersson Hammarstrand, a lawyer specialised in information technology. She covered the new laws that will come to pass in the European Union regarding how we are allowed to handle personal data.

I was very happy that she was willing to give a short interview for Hacker Public Radio.

It is interesting to see that it is not only consumers who are starting to think that information about us should be kept safe, it is also slowly becoming the law. If your work in or with companies in the European Union, this is definitely a heads-up, something to take notice of. In a couple of years time you must be ready to follow the new legislation.

In her talk Agnes also mentioned that companies should have someone who is responsible for privacy issues. Perhaps this is an opportunity for the HPR listeners? Most of you probably feel that this is an important topic already, so why not make it a part of your job description?

You find all the relevant links down below. If you want to send feedback or get in touch with either Agnes or me, please do not hesitate to do so. If you have any thoughts on the subject at hand or regarding the show, use any of the means below and speak your mind.

Beginner's guide to the night sky 2 - Andrew Conway | 2014-06-18


This is a review of some astronomy software, as used on the Earth in the early 21st Century, by a somewhat geeky chap. In this episode, I talk a little about two astronomy apps available for Android and another two available for GNU/Linux (and other) desktops. 

Erratum: I referred to Star Map but I meant Star Chart. Doh! 

In reverse order of how much I use and like them (most used/liked last): 

http://www.stellarium.org - Available for all major operating systems. This link shows you how to add your own comets: http://www.wikihow.com/Add-Comet-ISON-to-Stellarium 

http://edu.kde.org/kstars/ - KStars is part of the KDE SC Software Compilation) and so will be easy to install if you're a KDE user, or if you're not, "easy" after a few dependencies are installed. 

Google Sky Map can be installed on your mobile device using either f-droid or Google Play: https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=sky&fdid=com.google.android.stardroid https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid

Project Idea - White-Hat Spam Bot - Keith Murray | 2014-06-17


If you run a blog or a podcast, promoting your material can take as much time (or more) than content creation itself. Just like a small business marketing and promoting your efforts take time, effort and energy that can take you away from what you'd rather be doing: making great stuff.

This podcast discusses the germ of an idea, and its fledgling implementation, for creating an open-source tool for managing the distribution of posts to social media and doing it in as non-spammy a way as possible.

The premise is simple: take information from a number of disparate sources, and promote it to a number of disparate destinations. The challenge is doing it without violating the social norms of the destination networks, and without crossing the line between promotion and spaminess.

Wildswimming in France - Mark Waters | 2014-06-11


In this episode I take a swim along a section of the Charente river near Chatain in the Poitou-Charente region of France. I start upstream at the bridge and go down as far as the weir, then back. On the way I describe some of the things I am seeing, I pass some cows and a couple of French fishermen.

Apologies for the audio quality and panting, this was recorded by an old MP3 player cable-tied to a woolly hat.

Surviving A Roadtrip: GPS - Windigo | 2014-06-10


I have spent many, many hours in a vehicle driving around. While travelling, I've found a GPS to be one indispensable tool. These are some of the GPS-related tips that I have discovered: 
•Having a "navigator" - someone else to help operate the GPS - can be very helpful in stressful driving situations. If you have someone that can help, let them handle GPS programming. 
•Know how to operate your GPS. Planning routes are just the beginning; know how to get your GPS to find food and lodging nearby, and how to change a route to avoid trouble (road closures, traffic jams, detours). 
•Update your maps! Old map data can drive you into construction zones or route you into congested areas that new map data would have let you avoid. 
•Be aware of tolls! The Northeast loves road tolls, and they can quickly add up. My GPS has the option to route around toll roads; so you can use that, or make sure you are prepared for that expense. 
•You can also use your GPS as a normal map, except it's a map automatically centered on your exact position. In certain situations, this can be more useful than having your GPS provide you with directions. 
•My GPS tells me the local speed limit, in addition to how fast I'm going. This is an excellent way to avoid getting a ticket. 
•Mount your GPS somewhere. Looking down into your lap is a good way to find yourself in a gutter. 
•GPS are not 100% accurate! Don't believe their lies! If the directions they are giving you sound bogus, use your better judgement. 
•BONUS: Cameras! If you want to take pictures while on the road, try leaving your camera set to the "Landscape" macro if you have that option. It will prevent focus issues when taking quick shots. Also, keep your camera easily accessible to avoid extra distraction. If you have a navigator, they might be the best photographers.

Penguicon 2014 - Ahuka | 2014-06-09


Show notes: In late fall 2013 I became involved in the Penguicon convention, which combines Open Source technology with Science Fiction to create something that I believe to be unique. I ended up taking responsibility for organizing the Tech Track, and we ended up with around 70 hours of programming. I recap some of the highlights of my own personal experience of this event, both as a participant and as an organizer.

The set of prime numbers is infinite - johanv | 2014-05-27


In this short article I want to talk about prime numbers. In praticular: about the fact that there exist an infinite number of prime numbers. This has been proven more than 2000 years ago, but I noticed that a lot of my friends that don't have a mathematical background, aren't aware of this fact. 

Yet it is rather easy to prove. So that is what I'll be doing in this article. If you are afraid of math, don't worry, it won't take more than 10 minutes.

Give The Small Guy A Try - Beeza | 2014-05-22


Beeza hates being told what to do. When he moved over to Linux he noticed how most users were barely scratching the surface of the huge choice of software offered by the repositories. Rather than just go with the flow and settle for what everybody else was using, it was in his nature to look for alternatives to the most popular applications. 

He discovered some total rubbish, but also some real gems which deserve far greater exposure than they receive. Reviews of some of these excellent but relatively unknown packages will form the basis of future HPR episodes. 

In this episode Beeza makes the case for investing a little time digging around in the repositories to see if there is software which may suit your requirements better than the mainstream applications.

Stir-Fried Stochasticity: Bio-Boogers - Epicanis | 2014-05-21


This is a show concept I came up with half a decade ago, as the show itself explains. The journal article may be found as PubMed ID#19323757 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19323757 ) if you want to follow along. 

Hopefully the updated time references below for the show-note comments are now correct for this version of it. They should be close, anyway. 

Also, I'm oddly pleased at how inferior the "old" part of today's episode sounds: it means I've actually gotten a lot better at recording and editing. (It's quite listenable still, I think, it just doesn't sound as good as the newer stuff.)

Adopting and Renovating a Public-Domain Counterpoint Textbook - Jon Kulp | 2014-05-20


In this episode I discuss the problem of increasingly expensive college textbooks, and share with you the solution I devised to combat the problem in my counterpoint class at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. 

Part of the solution is to adopt a public-domain textbook that's more than 100 years old, and to give the text a 21st-century makeover that I believe will make it even better-suited for the digital age than any other comparable book in the market at any price. 

http://jonathankulp.org/gratis.html: The counterpoint page on my website, with source files and information about my creative-commons counterpoint workbook, "Gratis ad Parnassum," as well as links to the 1910 counterpoint textbook by Percy Goetschius: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Goetschius entitled "Exercises in Elementary Counterpoint."

In Defense of Play - Charles in NJ | 2014-05-14


This episode is a just-for-fun show in which I make a few observations in defense of just playing around. We need to stop worrying about work and to-do lists every once in a while in order to just get up off our chairs and do something that is fun. It doesn't have to have a structure at first, but it should involve a challenge or exposure to at least one new thing, or place, or person, or idea. I think it is the best way to learn, because the knowledge and acquisition of skills sneak up on you while you are having fun. It may be the only way to make learning really stick, and to stick with the learning process.

wiki on the raspberry pi - MrX | 2014-04-28


My experience of playing with wiki software on the raspberry pi, I forgot to mention I run the standard rasbian distribution on my pi if you run something else your mileage may vary. 

When I listened to the show I noticed a few mistakes, there may be others as the show was pulled together rather hastily 

1. The raspberry pi has either 256 or 512 MB of memory Not KB's oops 

2. You can automatically create pages using camel-case words they don't need to start with the word wiki so in my example the page WikiNotes could just as easily be called GuffNotes. This is because at first I didnt appreciate the meaning of the word camelcase, you learn something new every day! 

3. Wikidot still provides a free account, oops again!

Continuous Ink Supply System - Ken Fallon | 2014-04-04


The cost of printing

The reason that printers are so affordable is because like game consoles, they are not. They are sold at cost or below cost. The printer manufacturers make their money by selling you replacement ink cartridges that are very expensive. While you can use replacement cartridges, the manufactures will try and dissuade you from using them by displaying messages in the screens to "alert" you to the fact, or will include chips in their printers to prevent you from refilling or swapping their cartridges for cheaper alternatives. You should consider a laser printer option as while the toner cartridges are more expensive, even those supplied by the manufacturers work out cheaper over time. But if you wish to use a Ink Jet, then a serious alternative to lower the cost of printing is to use a CISS, Continuous ink supply system.

CISS, Continuous ink supply system

A CISS, Continuous ink supply system, is a system where you use cheaper non brand ink in your printer, just like you would with replacement no-name brand cartridges. Instead of having to refill the cartridges as they empty you supply them via a thin hose to an external reservoir. The advantage is that you can buy your ink in bulk and refill it without having to open the printer. This brings the cost of printing considerably.
link to picture of CISS printer

Now to pick a printer
1.What Functions would you like ?
 In the Netherlands there is an excellent site called Tweakers.net that allow you to select devices by their features without having to gather all the information from various review sites that may/may not be influenced by outside forces. Although the site is in Dutch it should be fairly obvious what's been asked.
https://tweakers.net/categorie/922/printers/producten/ (Google Translate version)
2.Will it work with Linux
 Once you short list the printer(s) you like, head over to https://www.openprinting.org/printers to find out if it's supported by Linux and by extension Mac/iOS. Do this even if you plan to run Windows as it proves that the printer is popular and is likely to be supported.
3.Will it really work with Linux
 Support is a big word and while it may be trivial for some to recompile a Kernel and X to get the thing working. It saves a lot of time and effort if you look around on the Linux Distributions forums to see if there are reported problems installing the printer. A good search is "${your printer model number} linux howto", check the dates on the posts as well paying more attention to the newer ones. Don't worry if you find a HowTo on another distribution than the one you are using as the chances are good that it will also apply to your install.
4.Can you easily use replacement cartridges ?
 For to answer this, you will need to search in your local stores and on-line to see if there is a popular replacement option available. You should pay particular care to whither the cartridges require a chip or not.
5.Is there a CISS option
 Now you need to check for a CISS supplier and to see whither they have a supported model for your printer and if there is instruction videos on how to install them
 For my purposes "City Ink Express" http://www.cityinkexpress.co.uk/ciss fitted the bill on both counts. They are a UK store and the only purchase I made arrived before the printer I ordered and the ink system seems to work fine.

Brother MFC-J5910DW

I ended up going with the "Brother MFC-J5910DW" as we were looking for a printer that could scan to the network, print A3, A4 duplex, as well as supporting Linux. At the time of writhing the Brother printers do not use any chips and allow you to replace the cartridges. One annoying thing was that when the ink in one of the supplied cartridges went empty (after printing 10 A3 pages), it no longer allowed me to scan to the network. Fortunately I had the CISS system ready to rock and to be honest I was dreading installing it.

Even if you don't want to purchase your CISS system from City Ink Express, you should have a look at their videos. For my printer there were three that were appropriate, namely how to Fill and prime it, how to install it and (for the future) how to refill it. I'm not going to waste time on my experiences as I have nothing to add to the videos other than to say, you may want to put on a pair of gloves and do your work over a news paper to capture any ink that spills.

Ciss continuous ink system for Brother LC1220, LC1240, LC1280 Printers

I'm not using the system or the printer long enough to give a full review but the CISS system has saved two birthday parties so not a bad start.

FOSDEM Discussion - Dave Morriss | 2014-03-26


I decided to attend FOSDEM 2014 this year. I had thought about going to last year's conference but didn't get organised enough to make it. When I mentioned my plans to my friend Tom, he thought he'd attend too, and we agreed to meet up there. 

When we got back from the conference I wanted to record a conversation with Tom about our impressions of the event. We tried to do this four times before we finally managed it. We struggled through one recorder battery failure and two Mumble failures before we achieved success. This is the result of our conversation. 

Apologies for the phone interference in the background, I hadn't realised the recorder (a Tascam DR-07) would pick them up.

Learn to read time with ccClock - Ken Fallon | 2014-03-21


Over the years the image of the clock has been abstracted and stylized to a point where a long and a short line inside a circle, or even inside four dots on the ordinals, can be instantaneously recognized as a clock. This is perfectly fine if you already know how to read the analog clock but it makes no sense to use such a design as a teaching aid.

oval with two hands Creative Commons Clock

As a teaching device, you need to make sure all the information that has been abstracted away has been put back.

That is the basic principle of the ccClock
•The minute hand points at the minute dial
•All the minutes are listed removing the need to know the 5 or 15 math table
•The Clockwise direction is emphasized with arrows and text orientation.
•The two per day rotation of the hour hand is described using a concentric spiral
•The progression of day into night is indicated by recognizable icons of the rising and setting sun and moon
•The written format is described in the traditional dial digits
•The spoken form is described in speech balloons

01:05:30 XMPP realtime lounge

Lights, Sensors, Switches, Dimmers and of course the obligatory RaspberryPi and a bread board. So what is this you ask ? Well Ralph Meijer, Edwin Mons and Joachim Lindborg explain the "Internet of things" and how they want to use the XMPP protocol to "chat" with your devices. The plan is simple: set-up each device so it can talk to XMPP, then you can use Jabber or any other XMPP client to talk to them. 


The lads from the XMPP realtime lounge

The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data. The technology pages provide more information about the various XMPP “building blocks”. Several books about Jabber/XMPP technologies are available, as well.

00:36:09 Pandora

Next a chat with an Evildragon aka Michael Mrozek who talks to us about the OpenPandora device, and what's coming next.

The Pandora is a handheld game console designed to take advantage of existing open source software and to be a target for homebrew development. The first copy was released in May 2008 and others in May 2010, and is developed by OpenPandora, which is made up of former distributors and community members of the GP32 and GP2X handhelds. When announcing the system, the designers of Pandora stated that it would be more powerful than any handheld video game console that had yet existed. It includes several features that no handheld game consoles have previously had, making it a cross between a handheld game console and a subnotebook.

00:56:14 Puppet

Over at the Puppet booth we talk to Eric Sorenson from PuppetLabs and Bert Van Vreckem from the Belgium Puppet user group.

Puppet Open Source is a flexible, customizable framework available under the Apache 2.0 license designed to help system administrators automate the many repetitive tasks they regularly perform. As a declarative, model-based approach to IT automation, it lets you define the desired state - or the “what” - of your infrastructure using the Puppet configuration language. Once these configurations are deployed, Puppet automatically installs the necessary packages and starts the related services, and then regularly enforces the desired state. In automating the mundane, Puppet frees you to work on more challenging projects with higher business impact. Puppet Open Source is the underlying technology for Puppet Enterprise and runs on all major Linux distributions, major Unix platforms like Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX, and Microsoft Windows.

00:27:07 KDE

Over at the KDE booth, I managed to track down Jonathan Riddell about the KDE project. From Wikipedia: 

KDE (/?ke?di??i?/) is an international free software community producing an integrated set of cross-platform applications designed to run on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Microsoft Windows, and OS X systems. It is known for its Plasma Desktop, a desktop environment provided as the default working environment on many Linux distributions, such as openSUSE, Mageia and Kubuntu and is default desktop environment on PC-BSD a BSD operating system.
 The goal of the community is to provide basic desktop functions and applications for daily needs as well as tools and documentation for developers to write stand-alone applications for the system. In this regard, the KDE project serves as an umbrella project for many standalone applications and smaller projects that are based on KDE technology. These include Calligra Suite, digiKam, Rekonq, K3b, and many others.
 KDE software is based on the Qt framework. The original GPL version of this toolkit only existed for the X11 platform, but with the release of Qt 4, LGPL versions are available for all platforms. This allows KDE software based on Qt 4 to also be distributed to Microsoft Windows and OS X.

Starting a series of RedHat interviews we interview Jim Perrin Governing Board member of the CentOS project. 
   

The CentOS trio.

The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable and reproduceable platform derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). We are now looking to expand on that by creating the resources needed by other communities to come together and be able to buld on the CentOS Linux platform. And today we start the process by delivering a clear governance model, increased transparency and access. In the coming weeks we aim to publish our own roadmap that includes variants of the core CentOS Linux.

01:23:08 RedHat: Foreman, oVirt, and Open Stack

Daniel Lobato and Doran Fedu help me understand what Foreman, oVirt, and OpenStack is all about. 

Foreman

Foreman is an open source project that gives system administrators the power to easily automate repetitive tasks, quickly deploy applications, and proactively manage servers, on-premises or in the cloud. (From Wikipedia) Foreman (also known as The Foreman) is a complete life cycle systems management tool for physical and virtual servers with deep integration to configuration management software, specifically Puppet. The Foreman provides provisioning on bare-metal (through managed DHCP, DNS, TFTP, and PXE-based unattended installations), virtualization and cloud. The Foreman provides comprehensive, auditable interaction facilities including a web frontend, command line interface and robust, REST API. 

oVirt

oVirt manages virtual machines, storage and virtualized networks. (From Wikipedia) oVirt is a free platform virtualization management web application community project started by Red Hat. oVirt is built on libvirt which could allow it to manage virtual machines hosted on any supported backend, including KVM, Xen and VirtualBox. However, oVirt is currently focused on KVM alone. oVirt is an open source software with backing from Red Hat and it is the base for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization. 

OpenStack

OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface.

For some reason my Zoom H2 failed to record this interview. Based on past experience I'm more inclined to blame the operator than the device so the audio is taken from the backup recording device, a Sansa Clip. As we say at HPR, any recording is better than no recording so any strange audio artefacts are a result of that.

Timelapse Video - Peter64 | 2014-02-20


A quick introduction to timelapse video and some of the tools used in linux to help create them. 

cd to dir that holds the images 

Create a directory called resize and run 

"mogrify -path resize -resize 1920x1080! *.JPG" 

If you need to Deflicker your images place the script in your resize directory and run 

"./timelapse-deflicker.pl -v" 

This will create a dir called deflickered 

If you use mencoder to create your video you need to use ls and make a text file with the files listed in sequential order 

"ls -1tr | grep -v files.txt > files.txt" 

then 

"mencoder -nosound -noskip -oac copy -ovc copy -o outputfile.avi -mf fps=25 'mf://@files.txt' 

if you use ffmpeg something like this should get you out of trouble, though your files need to be named in sequential order starting with img(number 1 2 etc).jpg 

"ffmpeg -f image2 -i img%d.jpg -vcodec libx264 outputfile.mp4"

00:39:46 Libre Graphics magazine

Changing the pace from mapping we get to talk with ginger "all-lower-case" coons :) about producing the Libre Graphics magazine using all Free Software 

A Libre Graphics Magazine is long overdue. In a market dominated by magazines devoted to design discourse built around proprietary tools and the latest computer graphics tricks and techniques, users of Libre Graphics software are underserved and unrecognized. We know that these users exist, both professionally and as hobbyists. We know this because we are they. We are graphic designers, media artists, photographers and web designers. We use Libre Graphics software, quietly and without regard. Our peers, used to proprietary alternatives, question our choice of tools. Our work, when executed well, is indistinguishable from work produced by more traditional means. Thus, our choices are invisible, unless we make an issue of them.

00:45:18 openSUSE

Next we talk to Richard Brown one of the board members of the openSUSE team. 

openSUSE is a free and Linux-based operating system for your PC, Laptop or Server. You can surf the web, manage your e-mails and photos, do office work, play videos or music and have a lot of fun!

00:56:48 The Debian Project

Debian developer and T-Shirt salesman, Joost van Baal-Ilić takes some time away from the booth to give us the run down on Debian. 

The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system. This operating system that we have created is called Debian. An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs. Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel. Linux is a piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. FreeBSD is an operating system including a kernel and other software.

HelenOS Screen Shot

HelenOS is an operating system based on a multiserver microkernel design. Rather sooner than later, HelenOS will become a complete and usable modern operating system, offering room for experimenting and research. HelenOS uses its own microkernel written from scratch and supports SMP, multitasking and multithreading on both 32-bit and 64-bit, little-endian and big-endian processor architectures, among which are AMD64/EM64T (x86-64), ARM, IA-32, IA-64 (Itanium), 32-bit MIPS, 32-bit PowerPC and SPARC V9. Thanks to the relatively high number of supported architectures and suitable design, HelenOS is very portable. On top of the microkernel, HelenOS provides services such as file systems, networking, device drivers and user interface. Most of these services are composed of multiple independent server processes, which makes HelenOS one of the most modular operating systems.

Fahrenheit 212 - cyan | 2014-01-28


Please consider recording an episode for Hacker Public Radio. We are a you-contribute podcast. :)

Ken requests an episode on Fahrenheit, which really requires discussion of the two temperature systems, and how they are quantified.

Terminology

Centigrade: old fashioned term for Celsius
 Kelvin (K): less common measurement of temperature used for Science
 Thermal Equilibrium: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium
 Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics
 Absolute zero: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero


My personal preference is Celsius. Less numbers to deal with in everyday use.
 Really Cold – Temperatures below 0°C
 Really Hot – Temperatures above 30°C
 The "American" thinking is temperatures go in 20's, 30's, 40's...etc. more work!
 Obligatory gun discussion
 Indirect conversation about PV = nRT formula
 Correction: the absence of pressure (vacuum) causes water to boil.
 Celsius and Fahrenheit are "measured" by the states of water boiling/freezing.

Celsius
freezes at 0°
boils at 100°

Fahrenheit
freezes at 32
boils 212°

1 (K) Kelvin = -273.15°C

Coffee Stain Studios and the Sanctum games - Seetee | 2014-01-22


Do you know the Sanctum games? You should! Listen to Armin from Coffee Stain Studios on todays episode of Hacker Public Radio!

"We're actually working on Linux support. *pause* I don't know if I'm supposed to say that."
 -- Armin

Coffee Stain Studios

In 2010 a few students from the University of Skövde created the Indie game developing company "Coffee Stain Studios". In 2011 they released the game "Sanctum" on Steam, and in May of 2013 they released "Sanctum 2". These games are most often described as a mix between First-person shooter and Tower defense. You find yourself in a futuristic setting, fighting aliens with a fair bit of humor. The player chooses how much resources to distribute on automatic towers or his or her own weapons. Both games featured the possibility to collaborate with your friends to beat the levels.

One of the founders, Armin Ibrisagic, was at DreamHack in November 2013, where I got a chance to talk to him.

DreamHack

"What is DreamHack?" you ask? Only the world's largest computer festival, held multiple times a year in Jönköping, Sweden. According to Wikipedia "It holds the world record (as recognized by the Guinness Book of Records and Twin Galaxies) for the world's largest LAN party and computer festival, and has held the record for the world's fastest Internet connection, and the record in most generated traffic."

I also got an interview with one of the organizers of DreamHack, but that you will hear another day. Today we focus on Sanctum, and how the market looks for smaller game developers.

Decoding HPR1216 the easy way and a bit more - mirwi | 2014-01-21


This Episode is kind of a direct response to HPR1343 by Laindir, where he explains his awesome way to decode the morse code in HPR1216. For the fun of it, I start right out by digressing into a memory of mine. It is about how I tried to decode morse code telemetry from the AO-21 amateur radio satellite some 20 years ago by using a CBM-8032 computer. 

After that I reveal the easy way to decode HPR1216 by using the CW mode of the program FLDIGI. Along the way, I mention the use of "monitors" in pulse audio, which are selectable in pavucontrol as input sources for audio applications. This is an easy way to loop back sound output from other applications. This method also combines nicely with WEBSDR, web accessible software defined receivers, all over the world. These may be used if you want to throw some real world signals at FLDIGI to play with the different modes. For listening to amateur radio communication I recommend to start out with one of these modes: CW (morse telegraphy), PSK > BPSK31 (very common, narrow band tele type mode) and RTTY > RTTY-45 ("original" radio tele type). For the typing modes you might want to check also "View>Waterfall>Docked scope" or activate "View>View/Hide Channels". 

Finally I add a tip about using OSS-wrappers like aoss, from alsa-oss, and padsp from the pulseaudio-utils package, to run old OSS applications. I use this primarily for siggen, a suit of command line / curses applications for generating audio signals like sine wave, rectangle and so on. 

NOTE: There is one stumbling block with pavucontrol, which I forgot to mention in the recording. Applications will only show up as playback sources or recording sinks when they actively use the interface. That is, the alsa player source will only be visible while playing, in the same way as an audacity sink can only be seen while the recording is going on.

A Visit to Reglue - David Whitman | 2014-01-20


Recycled Electronics and Gnu/Linux Used for Education. Reglue, in a nutshell, gives free Linux computers to under privileged children and their families. From their website: 

According to our estimates and those of the Austin Independent School District, there are over 5000 Austin students who cannot afford a computer or Internet access. Reglue wants to reduce that number by as much as we can. Since 2005 we have provided 1102 disadvantaged Austin-area kids and their families a computer. These kids cannot grow and compete with their peers unless they have a computer and Reglue focuses on giving these kids the tools they need.

Nido Media invades the Early Morning Show hosted by colleague host Brenno de Winter to talk about his talk on Censorship and Hacking in the Netherlands.

We discuss the situation of Alberto Stegeman, who proved the lack of security on Schiphol by touching the plane of the Queen.

Brenno's own adventures with the Dutch transportation card.

Henk Krol showed a medical system's security, a system considered to be "Top Notch Security", hinged on a (shared) password consisting of 5 numbers.

He also talks about the Dutch Responsible Disclosure procedure and what is wrong with it, including examples such as Hans Scheuder who found a flaw in Habbo Hotel.

Ilyam saw his little brother and sister taken away by the Child Protection Services by accident and decided to film it and go public with it.

Indigo - system for registering people immigrating to the netherlands. Contains markers like "You are ready to be removed".

Russian Activist fled to the Netherlands after he was let out of jail. Here he got cought in a system named 'Indigo' which is used by the immigration service. One of the flags this system can set on people is 'you are ready to be removed'.

Monty - The man behind your databases - Seetee | 2014-01-15


Listen to the man who created the database YOU use every day, today on Hacker Public Radio.

"There's no reasons to use MySQL anymore."
 -- Monty

Michael Widenius at FSCONS 2013

A couple of months ago I attended FSCONS 2013. There I met Michael "Monty" Widenius, the driving force behind both MySQL and MariaDB. This is a guy who loves being a developer and he loves Open Source software. He named MySQL after his daughter My, and the new fork MariaDB got its name from his other daughter Maria.

Monty was invited to FSCONS 2013 to give a speech entitled "The MySQL and MariaDB story", and the synopsis on fscons.org says:

"The story of how MySQL was created, why it was successful and how it grew until it was sold to Sun, who was then overtaken by Oracle.
 It will also cover how and why MariaDB was created and what we are doing to ensure that there will always be a free version of MySQL (under the name of MariaDB).
 The talk will also explain the challenges we have had to do this fork, especially the merge with MySQL 5.5, and the various systems (like buildbot) that we used to build the binaries and how we are working with the MariaDB/MySQL community."

-- https://frab.fscons.org/en/fscons13/public/events/51
That presentation can be found on YouTube, and I encourage you all to have a look at it. "Michael Monty Widenius: The MySQL and MariaDB story": http://youtu.be/JxyBNdwmpzM


If you have not yet made the switch to MariaDB, now is the time!

Monty also asks everyone who uses MariaDB to activate the anonymous plug-in, so that the developers might know what to focus their attention on.

If you wish to look Monty in the eyes, you have the opportunity to do so, as this interview was video recorded and will be released on YouTube or similar. Follow All In IT Radio on Google+, Twitter and Identi.ca for updates on when that will be released.

Doing the Lights on OHM2013. (shownotes donated by HobbyBob)

During the interview i mention the LOC controller. The LOC controller was designed by Bob from Bitlair Hackerspace in Amersfoort, The Netherlands.

Here you can find all the info on the controller:
•https://github.com/bobo1on1/loc_controller Also the wiki is a nice read:
•https://github.com/bobo1on1/loc_controller/wiki We also had the Proxy, you can find the repository here:
•https://github.com/bobo1on1/bobtricks
Finally we had some great help by Gavan and Kat from the UK during the event, they also made a repository for all the effects which you can run on the controller too:

•https://github.com/ohm2013loc/art The famous police effect (when the police was entering the field) is also in this repository !!! 
Lastly there is Bas' DMX controller, more info you can find here:

My username is hobbybob there, so if you have any questions just ask me in a pm. It is good habit that you introduce yourself on the forum, this will get you more credits when you start asking questions. Just introduce yourself, what you want to built and what you already have done/tried in the past.

Ohh and BTW i sound a bit dull because i was very tired. As the Light team, we worked from 9AM to 3AM every day during OHM to make the experience a colorful one for everyone!

We hope you enjoy(ed) our effort and start building cool stuff yourself !

If you want to make your own LOC controllers, LED effects or Lasers i am very interested to know. You can mail me: hobbybob at bitlair dot nl

hiro from GamingGrannar at Retrospelsmässan - Seetee | 2013-12-18


Today on Hacker Public Radio, we will talk about old games, and interview an expert from Sweden.

"GamingGrannar" and "Spelklassiker Musik"

In 2012, the Swedish gaming community "Level 7" voted for the blog Gaminggrannar to become "Gaming Blog of the year". Gaminggrannar (or "Gaming Neighbours") consists of David "Dave" Boström, Emelie "Ekken" Karlsson and Andreas "hiro" Karlsson.

Dave won the Swedish Championship in Nintendo, in 2003, and has a great Metroid collection. Ekken is an acomplished gamer, creates edible game cakes and also has a newly started collection of games with pink cartridges. hiro can be recognized by his retro game inspired tatoos, and is known for his love for series like Mega Man X and Castlevania.

Together the three neighbours release a video blog about everything and anything gaming related, but often with a focus on older games.

The podcast that hiro hosts together with Tobias Jensen, a NES and Amiga 500 gamer who wished he had more time for games, hit the 200th episode in november 2013.

Retrospelsmässan

hiro and I met at Retrospelsmässan 2013. This retro game convention is on its fourth year, and has grown considerably. Now in the second largest exhibition hall in Gothenburg, with roughly 2.000 visitors, and a three hour queue to get in. Competitions in old games, buy retrogames and consoles, cosplay competition, and so on. "Retrospelsmässan is a yearly event with focus on consoles and computers that was released before the year 2000." -- Markus Swerlander, one of the organisers.

The date for the 2014 edition of Retrospelsmässan is already set, saturday the 3rd of may in Eriksbergshallen, Gothenburg.

"Game and have fun!"
 -- hiro

Batteries Part 1 - MrX | 2013-12-11


A show about batteries - Part 1

I can't take the credit for all this detailed information in my podcast, I found this fantastic website many years ago while investigating why the battery in my expensive razor prematurely failed. I tried to hunt for the site but couldn't find it. I wrote up all my notes from memory and recorded the show. It wasn't until I started working on part 2 of my batteries show that I stumbled across this long forgotten site - at least I think it's the same one as it talks about the memory effect on satellites and doctor's pagers so I guess it must be the same one. I'm indeed delighted to find it still exists, and I may very well read it again from top to bottom. It looks like it's been updated a little too. Well done ka7oei a fantastic resource right enough.

Site title: "About NiMH and NiCd cells and batteries (And a little about LiIons, too...)" http://www.ka7oei.com/nicds.html

Two Possible Chargers (For use in the UK)

I found it very difficult to find a slow trickle charger, here are two possibilities, you may need to settle for a fast charger as the slow ones now seem to be like hen's teeth, (VERY HARD TO GET).

This is perhaps a little slow with a charge current of only 150ma, would take about 17Hrs to charge 2100 mAh batteries.

The charger I use is made by the same company as this although mine is a different model. My model charges at 200ma, and takes about 13 Hrs to charge a 2100 mAh battery. I can't tell what charge current this charger deliveries, but suspect it's a simple slow charger, probably old stock, as I said slow chargers are getting like hen's teeth.

Audio Metadata in Ogg, MP3, and others - Epicanis | 2013-12-04


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Metadata in MP3, Opus/Ogg/FLAC/Speex, and other audio files. 

Today's episode discusses (and encourages) the use of metadata tags in audio files. Most of the episode is spent on id3v2.3 (metadata for mp3 files) and vorbiscomments (metadata for opus, ogg vorbis, flac, and speex files), and how to mix them, though metadata in webm/matroska, windows media, and wav files is briefly discussed as well. 

This episode's files have also been crafted with substantially more metadata than the ID3v1 set of tags that HPR normally limits itself to, to serve as examples. 

Listeners to the opus, ogg (vorbis), or speex versions will also have access to chapter markings if your playback software recognizes standard vorbiscomment chapter metadata. (No chapter markings in the mp3, as support for it is extremely sparse, and I've not yet even managed to find a tool for making mp3 chapters that actually works - the java utility I mention in the episode crashes on me without starting...) 

All metadata conforms to the published standards, so your playback software should at best fully use it all, or at worst simply ignore it. If your player software actually DOES have a real problem with this file, I would very much like to know! 

If there's anything wrong with the metadata, blame Epicanis, not HPR (I did the metadata myself). 

If you hear or see any errors in this episode, please tell me. I'll issue appropriate corrections in subsequent episodes. If I'm a big enough screwup with this episode, I could even do a small episode on "everything I got wrong in my metadata episode" if I did badly enough. I don't THINK there should be more than a few minor errors or omissions here, though. 

ERRATA: In chapter 18 (at 34:53) there is one small error: oggenc does NOT transfer attached pictures from flac input (though it DOES transfer all vorbiscomment metadata. FLAC stores attached pictures in a separate metadata structure so oggenc misses it. opusenc - at least in recent beta versions - DOES appear to transfer the attached pictures as well as the vorbiscomments, though. Another reason to upgrade to opus, I suppose...)

Google Play Music All Access - Ahuka | 2013-12-02


This program is about the new online streaming music service from Google, called Google Play Music All Access.

Like many people I enjoy listening to music, and having my music with me everywhere is important. And I have a large music collection to draw on. Trying to have everything with me at all times is a bit of a problem, though, considering how much music I have. Right now I own a number of portable MP3 players, two of which are full of music that I carry with me. My pockets can get very full that way, though, and while I like listening to tracks I own, what about finding new stuff? My MP3 players have never suggested anything to me. This is where the cloud services come in.

JavaScript - sigflup | 2013-11-27


Sigflup calls in a "off the cuff" episode about JavaScript from the Hospital. 

JavaScript
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language. As part of web browsers, implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed. It has also become common in server-side programming, game development and the creation of desktop applications.
 JavaScript is a prototype-based scripting language with dynamic typing and has first-class functions. Its syntax was influenced by C. JavaScript copies many names and naming conventions from Java, but the two languages are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The key design principles within JavaScript are taken from the Self and Scheme programming languages. It is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
 The application of JavaScript to uses outside of web pages—for example, in PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets—is also significant. Newer and faster JavaScript VMs and frameworks built upon them (notably Node.js) have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side web applications.
 JavaScript was formalized in the ECMAScript language standard and is primarily used as part of a web browser (client-side JavaScript). This enables programmatic access to computational objects within a host environment.

Christmas Light Synchronization - Underruner | 2013-11-26


Hello hacker public radio

I have wanted to contribute to HPR for several months now. I find it annoying and pointless to create a script to read off. But after several attempts of trying to recording my self blathering on with stuttering, cursing, air gaps, and humming I had to script my episode. In this episode I would like to talk about building a Christmas light synchronization system.

I had first seen someone's home brew system years ago synchronized to music by the trans-Siberian orchestra. I was immediately mesmerized and went to work on figuring out how it was done.

I have had a fair amount of experience with fabrication and electricity over the years. However I really only know how to maintain systems that have already been engineered and fully vetted by others. My exploration led me to first find all of the unreliable sources and then on to the sites that leave out the magic step into getting their system to work. Truly reliable sources were scarce.

Frustrated with what I was finding, I gave up and my time was consumed with remodelling our home and moving to a different state into our new house.

Last year I wanted to start another attempt at making a system but time was short and planning something like this during the holidays is extremely dumb.

After the last holiday season and while putting away the holiday lights all I could think about is getting these lights synchronized for the next season. So I went back to the disinformation highway continuing my research.

Although I was looking strictly for technical information personal information leaked through.

The common theme amongst other people is to start planning for the next season in July. Starting to plan in January is a bad idea and all you will have is anguish when it comes time to deploy your show.

Soon July came along and I argued with myself if I was really going to commit myself to doing this. From what I have read I can be reassured that there is no backing out once you start. Most people talk about what they are going to add to their system next year.

So lets talk about the first step.

Some sites will say "GET AS MANY LIGHTS AS YOU CAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE"

This theme seems like a logical step, but I don't know what I'm doing!

I already have lots of lights, its not like I'm going to put up one hundred thousand lights this year. No my plans are to put up the same old lights I already have and incorporate them into the system and then grow from there.

So if I already have some lights I need a new step one.

Unfortunately most of the so called step by step lists don't agree on anything. So I chose what was most important just to get lights to work, even if I was never able to build my own synchronization system. The most important thing in any holiday lighting set-up is electricity. So that is the first thing I concentrated on. The front of my house has two outlets on two different circuits. One conveniently placed on the front porch, at the lowest spot on the porch with a plastic cover that is hinged to open upwards preventing direct line of sight when trying to plug an extension cord in. The second is behind a razor sharp ornamental grass bush. The two circuits are on 15 amp breakers and each outlet is installed with a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI). You make have seen these in your bathroom, they have a rest button and a test button. These circuits are not dedicated to these two outlets. They are connected to all of the rooms on the front side of the house. For me this simply will not do. Because when or if a breaker trips part of the house will go dark. Instead of fussing with these difficult circuits I decided to install two new circuits that would be exclusively dedicated for any out door lighting. My garage has a relatively empty breaker box so whatever I decide to do I'll have plenty of room to do it.

With my mind on future needs I made a check list of what I wanted
•# One. Two separate circuits
•# Two. 20 amps on each line
•# Three. The circuits need to terminate in two separate two gang boxes somewhere out in the yard where all the lights would connect to them.
And thats just what I did. From the breaker box I ran 12 gauge 3 wire (12/3) over head and down the wall into two separate junction boxes. 
A GFCI outlet is the first device connected from the home run between the breaker box and this junction box. So anything installed after this point will have GFCI protection. The second thing installed is a light switch that can create an open circuit to the power leaving the garage. I had thought about installing a digital timer instead of the light switches but the light switches are a cheap place holder until I make up my mind. the GFCI outlets and light switches are rated at 20 amps not 15. After the light switches, the circuits run out of the garage and are trenched about 30 inches below ground in PVC conduit. They reappear in a spot in the yard, terminated at the 2 gang outlets. This took quite sometime to do. All of my expenses are going into copper so the budget doesn't call for any machinery to help along the. So at this point regardless if I continue on with my adventures I should always have enough power just to run lights.

As the month went on I stumbled across Instructables.com and found a few people actually showing their secret sauce. I probably spent a whole month reading and then rereading what they were doing. There were only about six people that truly knew how to make a synchronization system and they all had one thing in common, Arduino. Without even really knowing what an Aduino is, I knew this was going to be the key to getting a system of my very own! Without hesitation I linked over to adafruit and bought an Arduino Uno. Everyone else had one, so why shouldnt I?

The Uno would only cost me $30 and I would be on my way to completing my goal. If you've never seen or heard of an Arduino they are credit card sized micro controllers that are made in Italy and are open sourced. The Arduino has one little hang up. Everything is programmed in C language. I know nothing of C or any real programming language. The only programing I have any experience with is HTML 1.0. These geriatric skills would not help me with the Arduino. Arduino helps you learn basic skills. You can read practice pages at Arduino.cc or you can use the Arduino examples built into their IDE software. The first tutorial I explored was the Blink command. The blink command you assign a name to the pin you want to use and then create a loop of turning the pin on and off, or HIGH and LOW. For me this was fun and now I am the lord of the blinks. I've been told that music is math. So I chose to experiment with this idea as my first arduino sketch. Arduino calls your program a sketch. So I found some sheet music with around eight notes. I printed the sheet music and then translated all of the notes into integers. Then I mapped the numbers to coordinate with the pins on ardunio. Uploaded the sketch and nothing happened.

You cant see the electricity moving around on the Arduino, I need to do something to ensure the program is working. I run over to Radio Shack to try to remedy this hang up as soon as possible. Radio Shack carries Arduino parts, so I bought a prototyping board, resistors and LED's.

LED's are great for flash lights and such. But when it comes to prototyping and experimenting LEDs are great indicators that circuits are working correctly. So I soldered up 8 leds, resistors and wires to the prototyping shield and placed the shield onto the Arduino.

I plugged power into the Arduino in and the lights started blinking. I gave my self a mental high five and congratulated my brain on a job well done. This test was successful, it was time to move on to the next step. I had already been over on amazon browsing relays and found a company on there called SainSmart that has prebuilt relay modules. I picked out a module that had 8 relays on it. This module was about $9 and I didn't think that I would be able to build something as nice as this for the same price. What I did next is sloppy and dangerous. Don't do this, I did it because I was following other peoples' instructions. People think its OK to run 120v into shoe boxes or clear rubber made totes. I did mine in an $8 home depot tool box. I wired everything up correctly and tested the system. I was able to get 8 strings of light to blink but I wasn't very happy with what I had. My idea for making the sequence, looked nice when it was only 8 leds blinking in a two by two inch square. Translate that to strings with 100 bulbs and it doesn't look sequenced. In-fact it looks like a sloppy attempt at being random. Maybe even call it laggy. it was bad.

I left out everything I had to do to get the system working because I don't want anyone to do this. Seriously don't run push high voltage into cheap plastic products. It's dumb and dangerous, I did it for you, so you don't have to.

However this first experiment passed all of my tests and filled in all the gaps in my mind. I know exactly what to do now and I'll cover my new box in detail. I suppose I skipped over what a relay is. You can think of a relay as an electromechanical light switch. They use direct current to drive a magnet to mechanically move an internal switch to create an open or closed circuit. These are the the devices that make it physically possible to synchronize a light show. While running my first prototype system a blue genie escaped from the board so I only have seven of eight relays working. It didn't bother me too much that one of them was broken because my plans are to build a larger system. I went back to Amazon again and this time purchased another eight relay module and then two sixteen relay modules. When talking about syncro systems a relay is called a channel, so with all my new hardware I now have enough to do 47 channels. The ardunio UNO only has 17 usable pins. So I needed to build multiple system or get a new controller. So I got a new controller. My new controller is still an Arduino, but instead of being the UNO it is now the MEGA. The MEGA is advertised to have 54 input/output ports. This more than enough to drive the relays I have. The issues of a proper enclosure is not trivial. This system contains high voltage and direct current electronics. I chose a Cantex twelve by twelve by six inch PVC junction box. The lid has six screws and a gasket to make the enclosure water tight.

The box was fairly expensive at thirty dollars but made everything feel better. In my collection of spare parts and junk I found a fist full of stand-offs and screws that actually had the same thread spacing. I drilled holes in the box and screwed in the stand-offs once I had the relays and Arduino parts mounted the way I liked I removed the hardware only leaving the screws and stand-offs.

Around all of the mounting hardware I used a combination of hot glue, silicone caulk and PVC cement to insulate the metal screws and to make their connections water tight. With the lid open and looking into the box the entire back side of the box fits the MEGA and two 16 relay modules. On the six inch side walls I was able to mount the eight relay modules. Before I mounted the relays for the last time I wired them up for high voltage. The relays have three set screws. The center screw is the common hot wire. For example from relay one I have a short 14 gauge wire running out of this screw and into a four port wire nut. Ideal makes a Push-In Wire connector that has 4 ports. The ports are bussed together and make for a cleaner install when compared to a standard twist wire nut. One push in connector can connect two relays and then jumper on to the next wire nut with two more relays, so on and so on. So there are 4 total relay modules and I connected all the common hots among all of them this way. When it came to the 16 relay modules I used tall standoffs so I could hide all this wire under them. So these connections are a little bit longer. The set screws in these modules can only handle up to 14 gauge wire. So thats what I used throughout. Before placing the modules you need to look at the other two set screws and make a decision. to the right of the common hot is the open side and to the left of the common hot is the closed side. At this point you have to think about your Christmas lights. Do you want them to be off all the time and have the relays turn them on to create your sequence. Your default state will be to have a dark yard. I chose to have them on at all times and I was going to create sequences where I would be turning them off. So even if nothing is happening the default state will be that my yard will be bright with lights. I also chose this way because if something breaks along the way I don't have to run out and re plug everything just to have lights on. But be careful as this will become confusing as we go along, its inverted from tradition thinking. With the relays wired with common hots, I installed them into the box and screwed them in. After that I tied the modules hots together. But made it more complicated than it needed to be. For some dumb reason I decided to load balance my box. Two relays per circuit. Back to my power, I ran two lines A and B. In side my box I made it so there was an A and B side too. Honestly everything can be tied together and it won't stress the system out the slightest. All it does is makes things more complicated. The next thing I did was connect all of the DC cables in the system. I created connectors from bits and parts laying around. Old IDE cables are nice for this. I wanted a completely modular system in case anything failed. So nothing is hard-wired soldered. I started out on the MEGA with Pin 22 and wired one pin to one relay pin. over and over again 47 times.

Then I created a power distribution board that distributes 12 volts to all of the relays and Arduino. I fitted everything up and ensured that everything fit and I had good connections. Then pulled the MEGA back out. Even though I have the relays in a box and all the hardware is connected the Mega has never been powered on. Its still dumb and doesn't know what it's supposed to be doing. Earlier I was talking about using sheet music to make a sequence and how that's a bad idea. I needed a new way to make blinky blinky. I found some popular windows software called Vixen Lights. Vixen is extremely granular lighting synchronization software. To the best of my knowledge it only works under Windows, although I have been trying to get it to work in WINE. Someday I'll get this to work. When you get Vixen up and running the screen looks like a spreadsheet, full of cells. Each cell represents time on a channel, double click the cell to turn it on or off. Some estimate that it could take several hours to synchronize three minutes of music. I'm not really concerned about making a sequence at this time. I move on because its more important to get a completed box in my mind. So let me help you spend some more money. When using Vixen the Ardunio needs to be connected to your computer via a USB cable. You'll configure Vixen to send serial to the com port that Ardunio is connected to. I have spare computers. But installing windows xp on a box and getting it configured is extremely annoying in its self. Then figuring out how to put a desktop in the yard adds to pointlessness. Some people might jump on the wifi bandwagon. There are to many devices on my network and I really don't want a power system to be available to the Internet. Plus why would you want your lights to be remotely operated like this. If you're not home why do you care if your lights are on or off. I'm doing this for me. The challenge is to eliminate the USB cable and keep it off the Internet.

I found out about wireless radios called xbee's. They are expensive, but do exactly what I want. They create a wireless serial connection at 9600 baud. When you're out shopping for your own there are two different types of xbee's. S1 and S2. I believe the S2's are also called zigbees and you can make them more secure than the S1. I ordered the wrong ones, I ordered the S1's. The S1's are extremely easy to set up. But to set them up you need more hardware. I ordered a majority of my hardware from Adafruit. So along with two xbees, I also got two xbee adapter kits and one FTDI cable. After building the adapter kits and plugging in the xbees I wired one of them into the Ardunio. For the Arduino side all you need is four wires. Ground, five volt power, transmit, and receive. The Uno has one TX/RX connection while the Mega has four. This doesn't matter since all Ardunio needs to do is listen. On your computer all you need to do is plug in the xbee using the FTDI. It is recognized as serial I believe in both Windows and Linux no drivers were needed to make it work. The only computer configuration needed is changing in Vixen, you need to tell Vixen what port it needs to use to send serial commands. But before you test this, you need to give your Arduino instructions. Here is the sketch I created for my system:

All the sketch really says is, listen to serial, take that info and do this. Upload the sketch using the USB cable plugged into your computer. I don't believe you can upload the sketch or make any changes to the sketch using xbee. Once I had this all setup, I built a 47 led array connected to the pins I want to use, plus the xbee. With a 9 volt battery and the Arduino, I tested this setup. My I created a one at a time sequence on my desktop and hit play. Immediately the lights started flashing. I walked away from the desktop antenna and I was able to venture about 100 feet from the antenna and maintain the signal. Everything is looking great.

I didn't change a thing with the Arduio and placed it in the box and connected it to the relays. I connected up the DC system and then tested the relays one at a time. This part was fairly amusing, 47 relays clicking is funny for some reason. I also used this time to play with my multimeter, I tested every aspect of the system before moving on. Making sure the set screws worked as claimed and everything was connected correctly. This will be the last time you have easy access to all the hardware so it needs to be verified. The next step is wiring the relays to do work. So lets do some money math real quick. I have 47 channels. Outdoor outlet boxes are only two gang. If you break the tabs off your outlets you can put 4 channels in one outdoor PVC box. Lets say that since you didn't destroy one of your relays you would have 48. 48 divided by 4 is twelve. You need 12 outdoor PVC boxes. At roughly $7 per box at a minimum that cost $84. Then add onto that receptacle covers They generally cost about $14 each. 12 times 14 equals 168 dollars. 84 + 168 = 252 dollars! This doesn't cover the cost of wire, outlets, and PVC fittings. 250 dollars just for molded plastic seems wasteful.

Its best practice to go with that method. I simply can not spend the money for that. Instead I went to the dollar store and bought enough green extension cords to complete my task. The extension cords are about 6 foot long. I cut about one third of the cable off of the male side. Since these extension cords are not solid core copper I stripped off a bit of the ends and twisted them before tinning the tips with solder. The relays have set screws and stranded wire doesn't make as nice of a connection as solid wire so by tinning the tips you're giving the screws something to bite onto. In conjunction with the extension cords I used electric glands to pass the wires through the wall of the junction box. I bought 6 of them and randomly divided all 47 extension cords through only 5 of them. The 6th one will be used for main power later on. As I installed the extension cords I labelled and color coordinated the female parts. And also hit it with the multimeter to double check my work. Once all the extension cords have been connected and verified, it's time to install the main power. In my junk pile I had about eight feet of 14/3 outdoor romex. I color coordinated both of these to indicate which one is A and B. There's nowhere to tie in the ground in this system, so I clipped that end off and then moved on to the white wires. I tied all of the neutrals together and then tested that with a multimeter, testing across the two furthest points ensuring a sure path. I used the same push-in connectors and several hot glue sticks to create a solid brick of push in connectors. Finally I tied the hot black wires into their sides and the system is complete. I ran a live test of the system a few weeks ago. I pulled out a few strings of lights and played around experimenting with the Vixen environment. I have a few ideas on how I would like to change the system but I haven't incorporated these ideas yet. What I would like to do is bring a raspberry pi in to remove my desktop. I found a program on SourceForge called Lumos. The creator claims that his program can play Vixen sequences via the command line in Linux. I would like to give this a try, or just get Vixen to work under Linux. I don't want to dedicate my main computer to perform this yearly task. I hope I have explained this clear enough. I don't participate in all the social media sites, but I do wear tinfoil hats. If you would like to reach me I hangout in the Podnutz Chat on freenode, my user name is Underruner. Thank you for listening.

How I Got Into Linux and OSS - Keith Murray | 2013-11-21


It seems that telling the tale of how you came to be an active user of Linux or open source software has become the de facto first show topic, so here's my story. I hope this slightly different take on the how-I-came-to-Linux story will be of some interest to you. If you're interested in any of the other things I do you can find me on twitter @kdmurray (https://twitter.com/kdmurray) or on my blog at http://kdmurray.net/.

Blogging With Octopress - Tony Pelaez | 2013-11-01


Blogging with Octopress

Static html site generators automate many of the tedious steps that are necessary to create website. Octopress is a static html generator that automates many of the tedious tasks of static html site generators, and comes with a number of reasonable presets, configured right out of the box.

Static HTML Site Generators I looked at:
•Jekyll: http://jekyllrb.com/
•Jekyll-bootsrap: http://jekyllbootstrap.com/
•Pelican: http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/
•Templer: http://www.steve.org.uk/Software/templer/ (HPR1203)
•Octopress: http://octopress.org

I settled on octopress for the following reasons: 
SASSSass adds additional functionality to css such as variables, mixins, scopes, and was a tool that I had previously worked with.Twitter BootstrapTwitter bootstrap is a set of templates that produce nice looking pages that are standards compliant, and adaptive so that they look good at any screen resolution. HTML5 Video PluginI ended up creating my own, but Octopress has a HTML5 video plugin. Unfortunately this only supported H264 video, so I created my own to serve H264, Webm, and Ogv.Deployment scriptsOctopress comes with rsync, and github pages support out of the box, so you can deploy your site with very little effort.

NaNoWriMo Prep - Heisenbug | 2013-10-31


I was prepping for National November Writing month (NaNoWriMo), and realized that I hadn't contributed a show in several years. I thought I would give a rundown on what NaNoWriMo is and what tools I use to write with. NaNoWriMo is where people get together to each write a 50,000 word novel rough draft in 30 days. It's not an easy task, and there are some tricks and tools that will help. My focus is on minimalism.

I'm Sorry Dan - Jezra | 2013-10-29


How many times has Dan asked me to run the spec test before pushing code to staging? probably 5. I'm sorry Dan. 

The script I used as my pre-commit hook is available at http://hoof.jezra.net/snip/of 

Oh, have I ever mentioned how much I dislike convoluted nomenclature? When I use 'git add', apparently I am adding a file or a change to the 'index', and it is the index that gets commited when I run 'git commit'

Some pacman Tips By Way of Repacing NetworkManager With WICD - FiftyOneFifty | 2013-10-23


A while back, I used my Arch laptop to pre-configure a router for a customer, which of course required me set up a static IP on my eth0. I should have done this from the command line, instead I used the graphical Network Manager. I had a lot of trouble getting the graphical application to accept a change in IP, and in getting to go back to DHCP when I was done, and I wound up going back and forth between the Network Manager and terminal commands. I've mentioned before my ISP is behind two NATed networks, the router in the outbuilding where the uplink to the ISP is (this is also the network my server is on) and the router in my house. The static IP I used for the customer router configuration was in the same address range as my "outside" network Though I successfully got eth0 back on DHCP, there was a phantom adapter still out there on the same range as the network my server was on, preventing me from ssh'ing in. I did come across a hack, if I set eth0 to an IP and mask of all zeros, then stopped and started dhcpcd on eth0, I could connect. I had also used the laptop on a customer's WiFi recently, and the connection was horrible.

I decided to see if just installing the wicd network manager would clear everything up (and it did), but before installing Wicd, I had to update the system, so first a little bit about pacman

Arch's primary package manager is pacman. The -S operator is for sync operations, including package installation, for instance:
# sudo pacman -S <package_name>

..... installs a package from the standard repos and is more or less equivalent to the Debian instruction .... # sudo apt-get install <package_name>

The option -y used with -S refreshes the master package list and -u updates all out of date packages, so the command 
# sudo pacman -Syu .... is equivalent to the Debian instruction .... 
# sudo apt-get update .... followed by .... 
# sudo apt-get upgrade
# sudo pacman -Syu <package_name1> <package_name2>


would update the system, then install the selected packages
 Perhaps because of my slow Internet, the first time through a few of the update packages timed out without downloading, so nothing installed. The second time through, even one of the repos didn't refresh. Thinking this was a connectivity problem, I kept trying the same update command over and over. Finally, I enlisted the help of Google.
 'pacman -Syy' forces a refresh of all package lists "even if they appear to be up to date". This seems to automagically fix the timeout and connection problems, and the next time I ran the update, it completed without complaint. I was mad at myself when I found the solution, because I remember I'd had the exact same problem and the exact same solution before and had forgotten them. Podcasting your errors is a great way of setting them in your memory.
 About the same time, I ran out of space on my 10Gb root partition. I remembered Peter64 had a similar problem, but I found a different solution than he did.
# sudo pacman -Sc

.... cleans packages that are no longer installed from the pacman cache as well as currently unused sync databases to free up disk space. I got 3Gb back! 'pacman -Scc' removes all files from the cache.
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wicd
 Use pacman to install the package 'wicd' and if you want a graphical front end, 'wicd-gtk' or 'wicd-kde' (in the AUR). For network notifications, install 'notification-daemon', or the smaller 'xfce4-notifyd' if you are NOT using Gnome.
 None of this enables wicd or makes it your default network manager on reboot, that you must do manually. First, stop all previously running network daemons (like netctl, netcfg, dhcpcd, NetworkManager) you probably won't have them all. Lets assume for the rest of the terminal commands, you are root, then do: # systemctl stop <package_name> i.e # systemctl stop NetworkManager


 Then we have to disable the old network tools so they don't conflict with wicd on reboot. # systemctl disable <package_name> i.e. # systemctl disable NetworkManager


 Make sure your login is in the users group # gpasswd -a USERNAME users


 Now, we have to initialize wicd # systemctl start wicd.service
# wicd-client


 Finally, enable wicd.service to load on your next boot up # systemctl enable wicd.service

Fixing a bad RSS feed - Dave Morriss | 2013-10-22


There have been problems with the podcast feed for "mintCast", apparently as a result of a bug in Wordpress. The feed contains multiple "enclosure" tags containing the same audio over and over again. While the mintCast hosts are looking for a fix I would like to find a local work-around. 

I have also encountered a problem with the "Pod Delusion Extra" feed which contains multiple enclosures in some episodes. Unlike the "mintCast" example I don't want to lose these enclosures but want to find a way of repackaging them into individual episodes. 

These problems affect some podcatchers, the modified Bashpodder I use being amongst them. To counteract this problem I have written two short Perl scripts to copy and clean each feed before submitting it to my podcatcher.

SFS and Linux Camp - David Willson | 2013-10-21


Hostname and email address: David Willson DLWillson@thegeek.nu , Gary (Garheade) Romero GARomero@thegeek.nu, Troy Ridgley TRRidgley@thegeek.nu 

The Software Freedom Society/School is a local movement to help anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of free software. Linux Camp, the latest success of SFS is discussed along with several of our other past and future projects. 

We hope to do another show soon, a Linux Camp Radio Show. We said in this interview that Linux Camp was a series of "real world task" labs, and we think that with a little work, they would make a good radio show. A show that an aspiring Linux SysAdmin, especially one that is studying for the LPIC-1 exams, could use as a list of challenge tasks to reinforce their skills. 

This is the book that we're using in our study groups: 
  CompTIA Linux+ Study Guide
  Publication Date: January 14, 2013
  ISBN-10: 1118531744
  ISBN-13: 978-1118531747


The Linux Camp document is here for now: 

https://zimbra.thegeek.nu/home/dlwillson@thegeek.nu/Shared/SFS/Linux%20Camp%202013/SFS%20Linux%20Camp.odt 

Eventually, we'll clean it up and put it on our website. 

Our goal is to build a fully free (libre) knowledge-sharing group with learning and payment options that work for everyone, from the penny-pinching enthusiast to the well-funded professional. 

To that end, we want your suggestions and welcome your feedback! 

To find out more about SFS and it's upcoming projects, go to: http://www.sofree.us 

To give feedback, leave a comment here or email any of the authors above. To join the conversation, send the word "subscribe" by email to sfs-request@thegeek.nu.

So, you've just installed Arch Linux, now what? Arch Lessons from a Newbie, Ep. 01 - FiftyOneFifty | 2013-10-14


Manually installing packages from the AUR

Since completing my conversion from Cinnarch to Antergos, (http://antergos.com/antergos-2013-05-12-were-back/, the published tutorial didn't work for me the first time, but the new Antergos forums were most helpful (http://forum.antergos.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=944&p=2892#p2892), a few utilities I installed under Cinnarch seem to be unavailable, notably, 'yaourt' Yet An Other User Repository, the package manager for the AUR (Arch User Repositories).[The AUR are unofficial, "use at your own risk" repositories, roughly analogous to using a ppa in Ubuntu.] I tried 'sudo pacman -S yaourt' and learned it wasn't found it the repositories (I should note that when I removed the old Cinnarch repos from /etc/pacman.conf, I must have missed including the new Antergos repos somehow). I have since completed the transition.

Anyway, some experienced Arch users like Peter64 and Artv61 had asked me why I was using yaourt anyway instead of installing packages manually, which they considered to be more secure. I decided to take the opportunity to learn how to install packages manually, and to my surprise, it was not nearly as complex as I had feared. I had promised a series of podcasts along the theme, "So, you've just installed Arch Linux, now what?" This may seem like I've jumped ahead a couple steps, but I wanted to bring it to you while it was fresh in my mind.

Your first step may be to ensure you really have to resort to the Arch User Repositories to install the app you are looking for. I'd found Doc Viewer allowed me to access PDFs in Arch, but I really preferred Okular that I'd used in other distros. When 'sudo pacman -S okular' failed to find the package, I assumed it was only available from the AUR. However, a Google search on [ arch install okular ] revealed the package I needed was kdegraphics-okular, which I installed from the standard Arch repos.

Once you've determined the package you need exists in the AUR and not in the standard repos, you need to locate the appropriate package build, your Google search will probably take care of that. The URL should be in the form http:aur.archlinux.org/packages/<package-name>. For the sake of example, lets go to https:aur.archlinux.org/packages/google-chrome/. Chromium is already in standard Arch repos, but if you want Chrome, you will have to find it in the AUR. Find the link labeled "Download the tarball", it will be a file ending ing .tar.gz Before downloading a file, the Arch Wiki instructions for manually installing packages from the AUR http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository recommend creating a designated folder to put them in, they suggest creating a "builds" folder in your home directory.

If you have a multi-core machine, you may be able to take advantage of a slight compiler performance increase by making adjustments to your /etc/makepkg.conf . Look for "CFLAGS=", it should have a first parameter that looks like -march=x86_64 or -march=i686 . Which ever it is, change it to -march=native and eliminate the second parameter that reads -mtune=generic . This will cause gcc to autdetect your processor type. Edit the next line, which begins with "CXXFLAGS", to read CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}", the just causes the CXXFLAGS setting to echo CFLAGS. Details are located in http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg.conf.

Before installing your first AUR package, you will have to install base-devel, [ pacman -S base-devel , {as root, so become root or use sudo}]. Look for that .tar.gz file you downloaded, still using Chrome as an example, it's google-chrome.tar.gz . Unravel the tarball with "tar -xvzf google-chrome.tar.gz". Now, in your ~/builds folder you should have a new directory named "google-chrome". Drop down into the new folder. Since user repos are not as trusted as the standard ones, it might be a good idea to open PKGBUILD and look for malicious Bash instructions. Do the same with the .install file. Build the new package with "make -s". The "-s" switch lets the compiler resolve any unmet dependencies by prompting you for the your sudo password.

You will have a new tarball in the format of <application name>-<application version number>-<package revision number>-<architecture>.pkg.tar.xz , in our google-chrome example, the file name was google-chrome-27.0.1453.110-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz . We install it with pacman's upgrade function "pacman -U google-chrome-27.0.1453.110-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz". This command will install the new package and create an RPM.

Before running Arch, I did not realize spell checking was centrally configured in Linux, I always assumed each application had it's own spell checker. After installing Arch, I noticed auto-correct wasn't working anywhere. At length, I looked for a solution. I found Libre Office and most browsers rely on hunspell for spell checking functions. To get it working, you just need to install hunspell and the hunspell library appropriate for you language, i.e. "pacman -S hunspell hunspell-en"

StraightTalk/Tracphone, a quick review.

Before leaving for Philadelphia last spring, I decided I needed a cheap smartphone on a prepaid plan. The only one with reliable service in my area is StraightTalk, or Tracphone, sold in Walmart. For $35 a month, they advertise unlimited data, talk, and text. The one drawback, any form of tethering, wired or wireless, violates StraightTalk's TOS (frankly I missed that condition before buying the phone). Hmm, would Chromecast count? Anyway, for some people, no tethering would be an immediate deal breaker. Frankly, I can see the advantages to tethering, but the one scenario I'm most interested in is isolating an infected system from a customer's network, and still be able to access anti malware resources. The budget phone I bought only supports 3G, and I'm not in the habit of streaming media to it, much less sharing it to another device.

That doesn't mean I don't use the bandwidth. I put a 16 gig SD card in my phone, and started using it as an additional pipeline to download Linux iso's. Anything I download, I can transfer to my network with ES File Explorer. I downloaded several Gigs in the first month to test the meaning of Unlimited. Towards the end of the month, and after I bought prepaid card for the next month, I had an off and on again data connection, I thought the provider was punishing me for being a hog, it turns out the phone was glitchy, and turning it off and back on again always re-establishes the data connection. Therefore, I am happy to report that StraightTalk actually seems to mean what they say when they advertise "Unlimited". Unfortunately, many of my direct downloads fail md5sum check. Direct downloads on 3G come down as fast as 75-100 MBps, but torrents seem to top out at 45MBps, the same as my home connection.

Stanford marshmallow experiment - Zachary De Santos | 2013-10-08


The Stanford marshmallow experiment (wiki) refers to a series of studies on delayed gratification in the late 1960s and early 1970s led by psychologist Walter Mischel, then a professor at Stanford University. In these studies, a child was offered a choice between one small reward (sometimes a marshmallow, but often a cookie or a pretzel, etc.) provided immediately or two small rewards if he or she waited until the experimenter returned (after an absence of approximately 15 minutes). In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI) and other life measures. However, recent work calls into question whether self-control, as opposed to strategic reasoning, determines children's behaviour.

The Origin of ONICS (My Intro) - Gabriel Evenfire | 2013-10-04


This show is about the Open Network Inspection Command Suite (ONICS). It is a project I have been working on at home for a couple of years now. The idea is to create a set of command line tools that work like cat, sed, awk, grep, etc but for network packets instead of lines of text. This podcast is actually less about the tools and more about the process that I went through to build it. So its more a tale of the project that was never done than an explanation of how to use the tools.

How to properly evangelize linux or why I use linux as my daily driver. - Riley Gelwicks (glwx) | 2013-09-30


Twitter/Identi.CA: @rileyinchina(Twitter)

How to properly evangelize technology or why I use linux as my daily driver.

Background:

I started linux in 2007 with ubuntu 7.04 because I bought a cheap laptop in china that only had the entry level windows vista in the belief that I could change the language. I use linux on both my work and home pc’s htpc and a server, it really is just amazing the different applications and things you can do with it.

Current PC is using: ubuntu 12.04

Some rules of the road:

Find the right time to broach the subject.Maybe when a person has to reinstall windows or they get a virus, or need to repurchase some piece of DRMed software.

Don’t talk down to anyone, laugh at them or be a jerk. The people we are trying to convert don’t use linux everyday or probably have a vague idea or understanding of what linux is, your mission is to be as patient as possible.

Don’t harp on how bad the system they are currently using is, find a situation in which they could benefit from the use of linux. The reason why fanboys exist is because we have this inherent need to not believe we are not wrong, if we are not wrong then surely the other guy is.

Don’t attempt to tell the person what free as free not free as in beer is. News alert, nobody cares, unfortunate as it may be nobody cares about these things.

Use practical examples as to why open source just works better: for me that’s wowing my coworkers by running a webserver on my desktop and having them test the various pieces of software before we settle on which one to put on our work server.

Show them how you use linux or other open source projects in your daily life, to me the best WOW factor comes from XBMC on a Home Theatre PC, add in a PVR and you’ll easily see people’s mouths drop.

Explain how open source is inherently more secure Linux has less exploited exploits

Use current events: NSA, Viruses the end of lifing of XP to show them why they should at least attempt it.

Ask them what they seriously use their computer for, my gut feeling is that about 75% of computer users don’t use anything on their computers that doesn’t already exist or have a worthy replacement in linux or an easy web application. And if worse comes to worse show them that they have the umbilical cord of WINE and or a virtual machine.

Appeal to their frugality:

Finally but probably most importantly put your money where your mouth is if you are taking the time to evangelize a product give a person some insurance:
1.Give a guaranteed tech support certificate to anyone that is willing to try.
2.Tell them to give linux a one day, one week and one month trial.
3.Help them install it.
4.Train them, most of us know that desktop linux is for all intents and purposes essentially the same as desktop Windows or Mac OSX

Filming a Dinosaur egg hatching - Ken Fallon | 2013-09-26


In this episode Ken and his Son hatch a plan to film a Dinosaur egg hatching using fswebcam. 

Groeiend Dinosaurus Ei
http://www.intertoys.nl/speelgoed/groeiend-dinosaurus-ei-577680.html 

We had to wait 8 days for a Dinosaur egg to hatch, so we rigged up a RasberryPi with a cheap usb cam to take pictures. This was just before the camera module was releases. However the principle was the same. We positioned the egg in a mixing bowl and placed it on some boxes to give it height. Then we used the handle of a camera stand as a place to clip on a cheap usb camera. We then connected the camera to a RasberryPi. 

the camera rig 

On the first day we let the light in and you see flickering as the lighting conditions change over the course of the day and the camera adjusts. Peter64 has promised a episode on how to fix this. So we closed the curtains and added an artificial light source as can be seen below. 

While we could have used fswebcam to automatically take the pictures, there was a certain satisfaction in seeing the program run every minute. Other than the default rasbian install, we installed fswebcam and screen. The first to take the pictures and the other to allow the script to continue running after we disconnected. 
$ cat egg.bash
#!/bin/bash
while true
do
  nowdate=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%SZ_%A)
  echo ${nowdate}
  fswebcam -r 640x480 \
           -S 15 \ 
           --flip h \
           --jpeg 95 \
           --shadow \
           --title "Dinosaur Hatching" \
           --subtitle "Pádraig Fallon" \
           --info "" \
           --save egg-${nowdate}.jpg
  sleep 1m
done


That produced a big long list of images, 10886 in total, and it was a "simple" matter to convert them to a mp4 file with ffmpeg. See http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html for more information on encoding for the web in general 
ffmpeg -y -r 120 -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i "*.jpg" -b:v 2000k -vcodec libvpx -quality best egg-libvpx.webm


   

Here's the finished product:

Too Clever For Your Own Good - laindir | 2013-09-25


Too Clever For Your Own Good

This is a story about being so lazy that I'd rather teach the computer to do something than learn how to do it myself. HPR episode 1216 (http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1216) piqued my curiosity, but rather than try to remember my Morse code, I decided I could teach the computer to translate it for me. This episode tells that story.

Commands

Uncompress the audio
sox hpr1216.ogg hpr1216.wav


Get the format data
soxi hpr1216.wav


Figure out how long the wav header is so we can skip it
sox -t raw -b 16 -r 44100 -c 1 -e signed-integer /dev/null empty.wav


Dump the audio data in a text format
hexdump -s 44 -v -e '220/2 "%04x"' -e '"\n"' hpr1216.wav > hpr1216.hex


Convert values near 0 to spaces so it's easier to parse (at least visually)
sed -e 's/000./    /g' -e 's/fff./    /g' hpr1216.hex > hpr1216.space


Run it through the following awk script to make it readable by morse
awk -f morse.awk hpr1216.space > hpr1216.dot


And the script

#morse.awk

Use morse to decode the translated output
morse -d < hpr1216.dot > hpr1216.txt


And this is what it looks like

IOS SOS SOS THE STANDARD EMERGENCY SIGNAL IN MORSE CODE. FOR EMERGENCY SIGNALS MORSE CODE CAN BE SENT BY WAY OF IMPROVISED SOURCES THAT CAN BE EASILY KEYED ON AND OFF MAKING IT ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND MOST VERSATILE METHODS OF TELECOMMUNICATION. THE MOST COMMON DISTRESS SIGNAL IS SOS OR THREE DOTS THREE DASHES AND THREE DOTS INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BY TREATY. MORSE CODE FROM WIKIPEDIA THE FREE ENCYCLOPEDIA MORSE CODE IS A METHOD OF TRANSMITTING TEXT INFORMATION AS A SERIES OF ON-OFF TONES LIGHTS OR CLICKS THAT CAN BE DIRECTLY UNDERSTOOD BY A SKILLED LISTENER OR OBSERVER WITHOUT SPECIAL EQUIPMENT. THE INTERNATIONAL MORSE CODE ENCODES THE ISO BASIC LATIN ALPHABET SOME EXTRA LATIN LETTERS THE ARABIC NUMERALS AND A SMALL SET OF PUNCTUATION AND PROCEDURAL SIGNALS AS STANDARDIZED SEQUENCES OF SHORT AND LONG SIGNALS CALLED DOTS AND DASHES OR DITS AND DAHS. BECAUSE MANY NON-ENGLISH NATURAL LANGUAGES USE MORE THAN THE 26 ROMAN LETTERS EXTENSIONS TO THE MORSE ALPHABET EXIST FOR THOSE LANGUAGES. EACH CHARACTER LETTER OR NUMERAL IS REPRESENTED BY A UNIQUE SEQUENCE OF DOTS AND DASHES. THE DURATION OF A DASH IS THREE TIMES THE DURATION OF A DOT. EACH DOT OR DASH IS FOLLOWED BY A SHORT SILENCE EQUAL TO THE DOT DURATION. THE LETTERS OF A WORD ARE SEPARATED BY A SPACE EQUAL TO THREE DOTS ONE DASH AND TWO WORDS ARE SEPARATED BY A SPACE EQUAL TO SEVEN DOTS. THE DOT DURATION IS THE BASIC UNIT OF TIME MEASUREMENT IN CODE TRANSMISSION. FOR EFFICIENCY THE LENGTH OF EACH CHARACTER IN MORSE IS APPROXIMATELY INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE IN ENGLISH. THUS THE MOST COMMON LETTER IN ENGLISH THE LETTER E HAS THE SHORTEST CODE A SINGLE DOT. MORSE CODE IS MOST POPULAR AMONG AMATEUR RADIO OPERATORS ALTHOUGH IT IS NO LONGER REQUIRED FOR LICENSING IN MOST COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE US. PILOTS AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS USUALLY NEED ONLY A CURSORY UNDERSTANDING. AERONAUTICAL NAVIGATIONAL AIDS SUCH AS VORS AND NDBS CONSTANTLY IDENTIFY IN MORSE CODE. COMPARED TO VOICE MORSE CODE IS LESS SENSITIVE TO POOR SIGNAL CONDITIONS YET STILL COMPREHENSIBLE TO HUMANS WITHOUT A DECODING DEVICE. MORSE IS THEREFORE A USEFUL ALTERNATIVE TO SYNTHESIZED SPEECH FOR SENDING AUTOMATED DATA TO SKILLED LISTENERS ON VOICE CHANNELS. MANY AMATEUR RADIO REPEATERS FOR EXAMPLE IDENTIFY WITH MORSE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE USED FOR VOICE COMMUNICATIONS. THERE ARE MANY APPLICATIONS IN LINUX TO HELP YOU LEARN MORSE CODE. CHECK OUT RADIO.LINUX.ORG.AU FOR A LIST OF APPLICATIONS.

A little googling will show that this text is the brief description of Morse code given at the top of its Wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). Surprisingly, the only transcription error appears to be the first letter as it was slightly overlapped by the intro music. It's also interesting to note that, since music consists of almost no sounds this short, the script was able to extract the data and robustly ignored everything else. In light of this, I probably could have skipped removing the wav header. Additional time could be saved by changing the regex in the awk script to match the raw hex values and thereby eliminate the sed step.

Out and about at OHM 2013 - Ken Fallon | 2013-09-20


OHM2013

https://ohm2013.org/site/ 

OHM2013. Observe, Hack, Make. A five day outdoor international camping festival for hackers and makers, and those with an inquisitive mind. On 31st July 2013, 3000 of those minds will descend upon on an unassuming patch of land, at the Geestmerambacht festival grounds, 30km north of Amsterdam.

It is a four year tradition in The Netherlands to hold such an event. In the spirit of WTH, HIP and HAR the latest edition, OHM2013, is a non-commercial community run event. The event happens thanks to the volunteers, all 3000 of them. They will run the network, help people around the site, give talks, hold workshops and be excellent to one another.

The target audience includes free-thinkers, philosophers, activists, geeks, scientists, artists, creative minds and a whole bunch of people interested in lots of interesting stuff.

Lock Picking

First port of call is a lock picking in a tent. Although lacking modern conveniences like, for example, doors, Nigel and the team has assembled a selection of locks for all levels. For more information contact Nigel Tolley from Discreet Security Solutions: http://www.tenburylocksmiths.co.uk/ 
 Follow @discreetsecure on Twitter 

Rainbow Island

Next stop "Rainbow island" for a chat with Johan, Brenn, Stitch and Joob. 
 From https://ohm2013.org/site/2013/06/07/project-rainbow-island-2500-sqm-of-old-skoolynessism/ 
Rainbow Island is possibly the most modest project you’ll see at OHM2013. Obviously, in this context, possibly means absolutely, and modest means insane.

The 2,500 sqm island on field R will be adorned by an immense castle-like structure, with towers that reach five meters into the air. In daylight, you’ll see just a marble-white castle. But at night, it turns into an oasis, nay, orgasm of colours, video projections, smoke, and laser-beams.

Inside the castle, several tents will be raised, containing all kinds of art and entertainment.

The first tent will host vintage pinball and arcade machines. But these are not just for mindless consumerism! There will be a large pinball-repair station, where these old machines can get the TLC they so often need. Bring your multi-meter, spare parts, screwdrivers, and hack away! There will be a number of machines eligible for improvement.

The second pair of tents will contain the complete collection of Awesome Retro, a group of retro-gaming enthusiasts who collect everything regarding gaming, as long as it’s over a decade old. You’ll find classics like Super Mario Kart and Bomberman, the first editions of Pong and Pac-Man, and a lot of other blasts from the past, which will wrap you like the warm blankets that they are. Besides that, you’ll find a fine collection of ultra-high-end Personal Computers, but to year-2000 standards, of course. A game of Quake 1 multiplayer, anyone?

A small and informal stage surrounded by sofas will also be available for competitions and presentations. In the time in between events, this “living room” is free to use as a cosy lounge. Because what better way to enjoy gaming than from a sofa, with friends, whilst eating crisps?

Rainbow Island sketchup april

And that is all, you think? Think again, because this is Rainbow Island, where the word “boundary” got scratched from the dictionary!

First of all, numerous smaller tents will be put up within the walls of the castle, consisting of the essentials of multi-player retro-gaming: comfy four-seater sofa, game console, great 4-player game, four controllers, a TV… and projector! Yes, the games will be projected on the castle walls, which are semi-transparent, so even people on the outside will be able to enjoy the competitions.

Next, the interiors of the four castle towers are available for all kinds of arts and other projects. These towers are 4 by 4 meters wide, and can be entered at the ground level. You may claim these for your own projects!

Other highlights which are in the process of being perceived –or otherwise prepared– are a life-size model of a CRAY-1 supercomputer, Operation Oversight (a master-control room putting you in the driver’s seat of the world’s super powers), and of course the results of the Dance Dissect Repurpose competition.
 
Next we have a chat with Jeff POINCARE who was building a seat shaped like a Cray 1.
Cray-1
 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1 The Cray-1 was a supercomputer designed, manufactured and marketed by Cray Research. The first Cray-1 system was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976 and it went on to become one of the best known and most successful supercomputers in history. The Cray-1's architect was Seymour Cray, the chief engineer was Cray Research co-founder Lester Davis.

BruCON

From: http://2013.brucon.org/index.php/Main_Page
 BruCON is an annual security and hacker conference providing two days of an interesting atmosphere for open discussions of critical infosec issues, privacy, information technology and its cultural/technical implications on society. Organized in Belgium, BruCON offers a high quality line up of speakers, security challenges and interesting workshops. BruCON is a conference by and for the security and hacker community. 

The conference tries to create bridges between the various actors active in computer security world, included but not limited to hackers, security professionals, security communities, non-profit organizations, CERTs, students, law enforcement agencies, etc..... 

Hackers are "persons who delight in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular." People who engage in illegal activities like unauthorized entry into computer systems are called crackers and don't have anything to do with hacking. BruCON doesn't promote any illegal activities and behavior. Many hackers today are employed by the security industry and test security software and systems to improve the security of our networks and applications. In addition, for the younger generations, we want to create some awareness and interest in IT students to learn more about IT Security. 

Trainings are planned for Sep 24-25, the conference for Sep 26-27. BruCON 2012 will be in the historic center of Ghent, Belgium. 
 
BlinkenArea

Then off to the BlinkenArea to learn how to solder under the able eye of Arne Rossius. 

Welcome in the BlinkenArea, the portal for "blinken" [=flashing/sparkling/blinking] projects. The BlinkenArea is a project group of people who are interested in computers and electronics and in a creative handling of both of it. They attend to the research and operation of flashing projects. In the meantime, more than 60 hard- and software projectes were developed. The group grows constantly and the number of small and big projects rises as well. The major projects have been the pixel room TROIA and the display building bluebox. Detailled information about all projects is available on the page Projects. News are always published in the BlinkenArea Blog. 

Origin and motivation

The page BlinkenArea tells you more about history, background and motivation. Apart from realising projects, the BlinkenArea people set their sights on collecting money which is scheduled to flow into public welfare, e.g. by selling own developed assembly kits or campaigns within bigger projects. The attention is focussed on supporting children, fighting against poverty and spreading education. Information about the social engagement of the BlinkenArea people can be found on the page Campaign. The BlinkenArea set further objectives which are listed on the page Goals. 

Contribute

Everybody who is interested in our "blinken" projects and wants to contribute or support our honorary work is cordially welcomed. We are always looking for software engineers, tinkerer, translators, news editors, designer, musicians (set movies to music), and -- of course -- new projects. If you want to join the BlinkenArea, please visit the page Join. The BlinkenArea runs a Mailinglist and a discussion forum where you can ask questions, join in the conversation or just read along. 

Press

Information for journalists and editors is available on the page Press.

PyOpenCL

http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl 

PyOpenCL lets you access the OpenCL parallel computation API from Python. Here's what sets PyOpenCL apart:
•Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free code.
•Completeness. PyOpenCL puts the full power of OpenCL’s API at your disposal, if you wish.
•Convenience. While PyOpenCL's primary focus is to make all of OpenCL accessible, it tries hard to make your life less complicated as it does so--without taking any shortcuts.
•Automatic Error Checking. All OpenCL errors are automatically translated into Python exceptions.
•Speed. PyOpenCL’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties above are virtually free.
•Helpful, complete documentation and a wiki.
•Liberal licensing (MIT).

PyCUDA

http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda 

PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API from Python. Several wrappers of the CUDA API already exist–so what's so special about PyCUDA?
•Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free code. PyCUDA knows about dependencies, too, so (for example) it won’t detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also freed.
•Convenience. Abstractions like pycuda.driver.SourceModule and pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray make CUDA programming even more convenient than with Nvidia’s C-based runtime.
•Completeness. PyCUDA puts the full power of CUDA’s driver API at your disposal, if you wish.
•Automatic Error Checking. All CUDA errors are automatically translated into Python exceptions.
•Speed. PyCUDA’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties above are virtually free.
•Helpful Documentation.

EMF Camp

Alec Wright (http://m0tei.co.uk/) and Chris Munroe (@chrismunro40x) make the mistake of giving me a leaflet. 
Electromagnetic Field (EMF) is a non-profit UK camping festival for those with an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things: hackers, geeks, scientists, engineers, artists, and crafters.

In the summer of 2012 we gathered hundreds of people in a field outside Milton Keynes for three days of talks and workshops covering everything from genetic modification to electronics, blacksmithing to high-energy physics, reverse engineering to lock picking, computer security to crocheting, and quadcopters to beer brewing. 

To help matters along, we arranged a 380-megabit internet connection, reliable WiFi, and a bar stocked with real ale.

Meanwhile Robert Fitzsimons is slaving away in the hardware hacking tent and gives us a rundown of his projects on display.

Open Garage

The "Open Garage" is a double garage in Borsbeek, Belgium, some sort of hackerspace, where I host weekly workshops and many of my projects. The garage is open every Thursday evening to everyone who wants to join our community's numerous hacking projects. 

Just be excellent to each other (principle #1 out of 1), bring a drink, a project and a friend and we're all set. 

I have all the tools and basic stock for elementary wood and metal working. Electronics gear and misc materials are available to tackle various projects. I also run a nano brewery from my garage, try to convert a car to electric, have a printrbot/Wallace++ 3D printer and we are trying to get a professional CNC mill and CNC lathe to work and I want to build a toolset for some DIY biotech, among many other things. 

Projects that have been successfully tackled or demoed at the garage are 3D printers and CNCs, a weather balloon, quadcopters, soldering and welding tutorials, a Tesla coil, beer brewing, a compost filtering machine, Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects, a windbelt, a Rubens' tube and many tens of other thingamajigs. 

For those that may be new and interested: There's usually a few technology-minded people that drop by on random Thursday evenings with "goesting" to make. Some people bring a project and others bring their skills to collaborate on others' projects. (and there's a lot of nerd talk) If you're into that kind of stuff, feel free to drop by. 

It is NOT required for your skills be on a high level, you are NOT required to contribute knowledge; instead, it is encouraged that everyone LEARNS stuff at our gatherings. 

I'd like to push my regulars to RSVP to the events, there's a lot of useful features in Meetup to share all kinds of stuff if you become part of the game ...

The Rosetta Dream - Julian Neuer | 2013-09-16


Julian Neuer (https://corianderpause.wordpress.com/) tells his short SciFi story "The Rosetta Dream", inspired by the writings of Steven Pinker and Jared Diamond.

In the 21st century, the Rosetta Project produced a disk containing 13,000 pages of information about more than 1,500 languages spoken on Earth today and in the recent past.

But what happens if the disk is found by our descendants in a very distant future where information is not transmitted by verbal languages anymore?

Jingles - Stitch | 2013-09-10


During OHM2013, we met up with stich and the crew on rainbow island and they were gracious enough to let HPR have a booth in the shade there. He also found some time to send us in some soundbytes (words) to be used for jingles. He says "It's food for editors and are not production ready jingles (i don't have background sounds). If you need any other rendition, just drop me a line." 

He releases them to us under a cc-by license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/).

About the Ohio LinuxFest

The Ohio LinuxFest is a grassroots conference for the GNU/Linux/Open Source Software/Free Software community that started in 2003 as a large inter-LUG meeting and has grown steadily since. It is a place for the community to gather and share information about Linux and Open Source Software. 

A large expo area adjacent to the conference rooms will feature exhibits from our sponsors as well as a large .org section from non-profit Open Source/Free Software projects. 

The Ohio LinuxFest welcomes people from all 50 states and international participants. We've had participants from Canada, England, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia in years past.

How I got into Linux - jrobb | 2013-08-23


This is my first HPR, first ever podcast, and first ever attempt at editing any audio. Don't expect greatness. The banging in the background is my daughter playing with something. I give a very quick rundown of my introduction to Linux, programming, and tech in general. This is a pretty short show. 

I forgot to mention that early on in high school or middle school I enjoyed playing with DOS on an old 386 and that is probably what got my interest and led me to enroll in the High School computer science class that I mention. I didn't really have anything planned to talk about, I should probably do that next time.

How I Manage Contacts - Jon Kulp | 2013-08-14


How I Manage Contacts

About a year ago I decided to try to clean up my contacts. 

The problem: CRUFT! 
•Importing, exporting re-importing in different accounts and in different email clients and several computers etc over span of ~10 years.
•1200+ gmail contacts
•Many duplicates

What I wanted:
•1 set of contacts across platforms with single source file from which all others are generated
•plain-text format, easy to use w/scripting & text editor
•No duplicates
•no cruft
•easy to maintain
•easy to import/export in T-bird, ownCloud
•sync with phone

Steps to Success:
1.Turn off Gmail default setting that saves every incoming email address in your address book
2.Deleted all extraneous contacts (went from ~1200 down to about 400)
3.Tedious part here: compare duplicates, consolidate info
4.Decide on source-file format
5.T-bird = LDIF
6.OwnCloud = vCard
7.LDIF wins b/c found script to convert to vCard, but not good script for other direction
8.Convert all disparate contacts lists to LDIF, begin consolidating into one file
9.LDIF ready? Import to T-bird
10.Perl script to convert LDIF to vCard –> import to ownCloud
11.CardDAV-sync to sync from o.c. to phone
12.Bash script to create new LDIF entries, convert to vcf, add to master file easily

Wishlist 
1.Make t-bird sync w/owncloud (t-bird SOGO extension broken)
2.CLI API to update owncloud contacts via a script instead of having to use the web interface

Energy Democracy defined - Bob Tregilus | 2013-08-09


This program is a special panel discussion episode of, This Week in Energy (TWiE), where co-hosts Kirsten & Bob define the concept of Energy Democracy and hacking the traditional central-station monopoly electric utility business model.

There's an energy transition (or "energiewende" in German) underway in the energy space where the 19th and 20th century central-station monopoly utility business model is breaking down (or getting hacked) and ownership of electric generation capacity is transferring to individuals, co-ops, and so forth.

This is due in large part to an entropy effect because "the ubiquitous nature of renewable energy argues for a decentralist energy approach." But, also, public policy can either help the energy transition move faster, or it can slow it down.

Thus an emerging global battle is brewing and it's very similar to the disruptions that have been taking place in the telecom sector due to advancements in IT and the advent of the Internet over the past couple of decades.

Hosts: Kirsten Hasberg (Denmark & Germany) and Bob Tregilus (U.S.A.) <http://www.thisweekinenergy.tv/>.

A Music Pairing Under Unlikely Circumstances - Dave Morriss | 2013-07-31


Today Dave interviews Tim, his son, and Tim's friend John, who is visiting from the USA. 

Tim and John met on the Internet in 2006 as collaborating composers of electronic music. They have become good friends over the years; Tim has visited John in the States, in 2011 where they met for the first time in real life, for John's wedding. This also marks the first time that John and his wife Caitlin have travelled overseas, which they did to visit Tim in the UK. 

In the podcast we discuss how they met, how their different world views affected each other, and how their relationship quickly transcended music. 

Here's a picture of Tim and John visiting Edinburgh Castle in July 2013:

Recording for HPR using Audacity - Nido Media | 2013-07-24


The almost failsafe short of it. Use "alsamixer" to boost all recording volumes on main pulse and all cards (e.g. "alsamixer -c 0"). Start Audacity, edit -> preferences, stay in the "device" submenu, don't bother with the "recording" submenu. For each of the "Hosts" (alsa/jack), try all "Device"s under the "Recording" tab, start speaking, notice volume (or not and try the next one) 

see http://www.hackerpublicradio.org/contribute.php for more text on recording and suggested topics

Intro to camp fires - pokey | 2013-07-22


I've always felt a little awkward in social situations, and I'm always looking for ways to get over that feeling. One way I do that is to try and make myself useful, and one useful thing that I know is how to light and keep a small fire going. No one else ever seems to want to do it, and it's fun if you do it right. Admittedly there isn't much to it, but that just makes it all that much easier to learn. It isn't quite as intuitive as you might think if you've never done it, especially if it's a little damp out. Use tinder (paper, dried grass, cotton balls, etc...) to get the flame going, light your kindling (small twigs, pinecones, split sticks) over the tinder, and increase the size of your kindling until you have a good pile of coals that can sustain the burning of split logs. Keep your logs and sticks as parallel as you can, make sure air can flow freely through your burning pile of wood and don't let your coals spread too thin. If you're good, you should be able to get a fire going with just a single match and no accelerants (which are usually illegal anyway). If you're really good, you might even be able to do it with just a spark.

Doomsday Remainders - Charles in NJ | 2013-07-16

Last Episode on Conway's Doomsday Rule ends with teaser on MOD(), a
"remainder" function defined for integer values (whole numbers):

   MOD(K, m) = remainder when K is divided by "modulus" m.
   
Examples: 
  a. MOD(207, 7) = MOD(207 - 140, 7) = MOD(67, 7) = 4
  b. MOD(1234567, 2) = 1 because the number is odd
  
MOD() function found in most spreadsheet programs, but it also shows up
as an operator in some programming languages: (a % b), or (a mod b).


Other functions referenced:
   DIV(K, m)    = quotient in integer division
      where K = m * quotient + remainder (not returned)
            0 <= remainder < m

   DIVMOD(K, m) = (quotient, remainder) when K is divided by m
      where remainder = MOD(K, m)
            quotient  = DIV(K, m)
            K = m * quotient + remainder

Parsing an ISO8601 formatted duration field with Perl - Dave Morriss | 2013-07-15


Ken recently asked Dave for help with a Perl regular expression for parsing ISO8601 time durations. As a consequence a Perl script was written, which is available at https://gitorious.org/hprmisc/hprmisc/blobs/master/parse_8601_duration. 

In this show Ken and Dave discuss this script at some (considerable) length. Keen listeners might want to view the script as they listen. Detailed show notes describing how to put together a Perl regular expression are also available at URL. 

Unfortunately some of the line numbers in the script referred to in the show are now incorrect since Dave could not stop himself updating it. 

For detailed show notes on how Dave created the script see:

MultiSystem: The Bootable Thumb Drive Creator - FiftyOneFifty | 2013-07-12


MultiSystem is a tool for creating bootable USB thumb drives that give you the option launching multiple ISO images and other built in diagnostic utilities. It can be an invaluable tool for system repair techs. Not to mention the many recovery and repair Live CDs that are available to fix Linux, most bootable Windows repair and anti-virus utilities run from a Linux based ISO. The tech can even create ISO images of Windows installation media and replace a stack of DVDs with one thumb drive. Besides the installable package, there is also a MultiSystem LiveCD http://sourceforge.net/projects/multisystem/ that, if I understand correctly, contains some recomended ISOs to install on your thumb drive.

Short Xen Update From JWP - JWP | 2013-07-11


Show Title - Short Xen Update From JWP 

In the Tilts 507 Rus came on as the Xen project manager. Had a lot to say about Xen but not about how xen is funded in the linux foundation by who. 

In the course of preparing for the podcast I learned that is not easy to see who gives money to the linux foundation. But Oracle is on the board directors along with all the major players in the IT space. 

I also learned weather it is type 1 or type 2 hypervisor it is not clear as it used to be. At work I do not get very many requests for anything but ESX, HyperV or KVM in that order. Once in a while a Xen or Oracle VM comes up. This might change with the open stack a bit but I am not sure. 

A good start to look at it is here: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-hypervisorcompare/ 

A better view of the real state of type 1 vs type 2 is here

Nido Media get's Ken to go camping at OHM2013 - Ken Fallon | 2013-07-10


Slowly but surely over the almost 15 years of his stay in the Netherlands, Ken has been Dutchafied. He's got a bakfiets, he learned the language(ish), he has a pair of wooden shoes, he even eats mayonnaise with his fries. But one thing he has rebelled against is camping (ok also Steak Tartare aka 'American Fillet' aka raw cow). That most Dutch of traditions, where the family head off to some deserted field, be it by the sea, in a forest, or on the polder, one thing is sure, it will be damp, wet, mosquito ridden, dark too late and bright too early, and wet - optionally cold and hot. In short hell. Of course that's his personal opinion. 

Of course, Nido Media sees it as a relaxing vacation away from the hustle and bustle of a busy life, fortified with happy memories where he and his family enjoyed the long summers days when it never rained and they were allowed to stay up late. 

So how can these two dividing opinions be bridged ? 

In short: Fiber to the Tent. https://ohm2013.org/site/

My Homemade Recumbent Bicycle - Jon Kulp | 2013-07-02


Jon's Recumbent Bicycle 
The Green ♲ Machine 

 In this episode I discuss my experience building a Recumbent Bicycle from donor bikes. A couple of things I forgot to mention while recording the podcast. First of all I had to use tandem bicycle cables for the brakes and the rear derailleur because they had to be very long. I also forgot to talk about the time when I was in a panic that the rear triangle was a bit out of alignment with the front, such that it would make the bike turn a little bit to the left by default. I called Andrew Carson and asked him if there was anything I could do to fix it and his solution was just awesome. What he told me to do was to put a spare hub in the rear triangle to keep the seat- and chain stays from collapsing together, lay the frame on the ground with the front end propped up on a step or something, and then just stand on it, jumping up and down slightly on it if necessary until I could feel it bend back a little bit. This actually worked! It straightened the frame right out. :) Finally, the total cost for this project was under $300. The most expensive single part of it by far was the powder coat, which cost $120. Here are links to resources mentioned in the podcast or simply of general interest.

How to Build a Desktop Computer - Toby Meehan | 2013-05-29


Show Notes for How to Build a Desktop 




Build vs Buy

Do you have the interest and time to research and build a desktop computer?

You probably won't save a lot of money, but with all the research you may get better quality parts.

You will know exactly what's in your system should issues or questions ever arise.




Gather requirements

Define the purpose of the system 

Use: gaming, video/photo processing, web browsing/documents

Applications should drive most of your hardware decisions.

Data protection: how much data, how resilient (on-site mirroring, RAID vs. off‐site)

Power protection: surge suppression, UPS

Physical protection: keyed case lock (disassembly prevention), cable anchor




Define a budget 

Decide what are you willing to spend (max, target, min)

  Check off‐the‐shelf models to get the going price points

Understand there are trade‐offs and if everything is needed at once

Adding capabilities later can help with sticker shock

If you have time, buy components when prices dip

Be careful about return policies...some 30 or 90 days




Learn about current technology & prices

Core: CPU, memory, motherboard, graphics controller, power supply

Storage: solid state drives, rotating hard drives, removable media (DVD, USB)

Auxiliary: audio, monitor, power protection, web cam, printer/scanner, backup drive

Interfaces: SATA, IDE, DDR2, DDR3, PCI, PCI‐e, USB, eSATA

Determine approximate price range

Where to research this stuff: Wikipedia, Tom's Hardware, Anandtech, Specs on vendor web sites

Where to shop: NewEgg.com, Amazon.com, Dell.com




Understand compatibility

Hardware‐Hardware compatibility

Check qualified hardware list (QHL) on CPU/memory/motherboard

Also known as CPU support list, memory support list, qualified vendor list, etc.

If you can stick to the QHL parts, h/w compatibility is more assured

Hardware‐Operating System compatibility 

Drivers, either built into the OS or from vendor web site

Pay attention to 32‐bit vs. 64‐bit in both operating systems and drivers

Operating System‐Application compatibility

I'm not going to address this, but it is something to research and understand.




Define what components you need

You will need the core and storage components.




If you have components (particularly auxiliary components) from a previous system, you may find you can use them with the new system. Speakers, printer, and monitors are all prime candidates.




Steps
1.
CPU

•
Decide on CPU brand (typically Intel or AMD)

•
Decide on CPU model, which is dictated by your needs and budget

•
CPU will dictate motherboard socket type

•
Be sure to buy CPU in box set so it includes CPU fan & heat‐sink. Otherwise, you'll need to figure out the thermal dissipation needs and physical dimension limitations of the case in order to select an appropriate 3rd party CPU fan & heat‐sink. This can involve liquid cooling solutions. I'm not covering thermal solutions in detail here.

2.
Motherboard

•
Narrow search to motherboards with socket type that matches CPU.

•
Decide on motherboard form factor (ATX, Mini‐ATX, Micro‐ATX, Mini‐ITX, etc.). See Wikipedia.

•
Video on‐board or discrete. 
◦
If on‐board, check if it has dedicated memory or borrows memory from main system. If it borrows from the main system, you may want to increase your memory size. Recommend using discrete if 3‐D requirements exist. You can go discrete later, but you'll have wasted money on the motherboard.

◦
If discrete, ensure motherboard has enough high‐end PCI‐e slots for your needs. 


•
Audio on‐board, discrete or external.
◦
If on‐board, check motherboard has suitable output ports for your needs.

◦
If discrete, ensure motherboard has a slot for the audio card.

◦
If external audio system will be used, make sure motherboard has ports to support it.

◦
WiFi / Blue Tooth

While a few motherboards have these, they are generally considered inferior for connectivity and security on a non‐mobile device like a desktop. It's also easy to add a card or USB device to obtain them. Also, when integrated on the motherboard, they are harder to upgrade later.


•
Outputs ports meet your needs (PS2, Parallel, Serial COM, USB, eSATA, S/PDIF, HDMI, Ethernet, etc.)

•
At this point, you search should be fairly narrow – compare prices, read reviews and compare ratings. 

•
Decide on motherboard vendor and model

3.
Memory

•
Based on motherboard, find matching memory type. DDR2 and DDR3 are the common types. 

There are 5 memory properties: 
1.
DDR revision (currently they include DDR, DDR2, and DDR3)

2.
Chip Classification (like DDR2‐1333) where the number (1333) is the maximum clock speed (in MHz) the memory chips support, which is halved for real clock speed (666.5MHz).

3.
Module Classification (like PC3‐10666) where the number (10666) is the maximum transfer rate (in MB/s). This is typically 8 times the first memory chip classification clock speed, so DDR400 transfers data at 3,200 MB/s. 

4.
Timing (like 7‐8‐8‐24) measures the time the memory chip delays doing something internally.

5.
Voltage (like 1.5v) 


•
Note the memory properties are maximums. Actual rates will be lower based on the motherboard. Match the first 3 properties – DDR revision, chip classification and module classification. DDR revision must match. If you can't get an exact match on Chip and Module classifications, make sure the memory module is faster (higher numbers) than the motherboard.

•
If you plan to over‐clock, you'll need to pay attention to all 5 properties, but I'm not going to cover over‐clocking.

•
For more assurance, buy memory that's on the motherboard maker's certified list.

•
Recommend buying memory in higher capacities per module for future expansion. If you have 4 memory module slots which can accept 1G, 2G, and 4G modules, opt for the 4G modules.

•
Recommend that all memory modules be the same size, optimally the same brand/model if possible.

4.
Video Card

•
If using on‐board video controller, you've already decided this.

•
If using discrete video card, narrow search to available motherboard slots. 

For example, if you only have one PCI‐e 16x slot, narrow search to video cards that can use that slot. Don't worry about AMD's CrossfireX or NVIDIA's SLI card linking because you don't have two slots. 

•
If you buy a high‐end discrete card or cards, be sure to check the video card vendor's recommended power supply wattage and required power connector. These cards often require a separate power connector from the power supply.

5.
Internal Storage 

•
By internal storage, I mean storage devices that will be housed inside the computer case.

•
Most motherboards come with an on‐board storage controller, typically SATA 2. Some have an IDE controller for legacy support. Server motherboards may have some version of SCSI or SAS (serial attached storage) controllers.

•
These on‐board controllers are configured from within the BIOS or UEFI. Depending on the motherboard's south bridge chipset, it may support a few RAID levels, usually levels 0 (striping) and 1 (mirroring).

•
Storage devices come in different physical sizes which require different sized bays ‐ 5.25 inch, 3.5 inch, 2.5 inch, and 1.8 inch. These refer the size of the storage medium, not the actual bay size. The 5.25 inch bays come in half‐height versions, which are the standard for CD and DVD drives in todays' computers. The 3.5 inch bays are usually used for floppy or Zip drives...more legacy equipment. See Wikipedia.

•
Storage devices can vary significantly in storage capacity. Often, the larger the storage capacity, the higher the latency in storing and retrieving data. Cache on‐board the disk can mitigate this latency, so larger cache sizes are preferred particularly for large capacity drives. Cache sizes currently include 8MB, 16MB, 32MB and 64MB.

•
With rotating magnetic disks, the speed at which they rotate can also mitigate this latency. Rotation speeds include 5400 rpm, 7200 rpm, and 10000 rpm and 15000 rpm with each step in speed requiring more power and giving off more heat.

•
If you need more than 2 or 3 drives, you'll need to ensure your case has adequate physical space for them and that your power supply is sized appropriately.




6.
Case & Power Supply

•
Some cases are bundled with a power supply, which might work great for average to low‐end system configurations.

•
Based on motherboard form factor and internal storage requirements, pick out a computer case. 

•
Case features to consider:
1.
Power supply location is always in rear, but can be on top or bottom of a tower configuration. If the computer will sit on the floor, having the power supply on the bottom might turn it into a dust bunny haven.

2.
Number and type of storage drive bays.

3.
Removable and/or washable dust filters.

4.
Lighting kits

5.
Front panel ports and static suppression


•
The number and size of fans is limited by the case design. Typically a case will come with one rear fan, but most offer front, side, or top vents where fans can be mounted. Fan sizes range from 25mm to 250mm, with popular sizes at 80mm, 92mm, 120mm and 140mm.

•
Make sure power supply is sized correctly:
1.
Physical dimensions fits in case (beware “slim” power supplies for smaller form factor cases).

2.
Wattage output, which is driven by video cards and number of internal storage devices.

3.
Connectors required by the motherboard, CPU fan, case fans, video card and internal storage devices.


•
Without a discrete video card and 2‐3 internal storage devices, 300‐400 Watts power supplies are typical. If getting a discrete video card, check on its power requirements.

•
Power supplies also have efficiency ratings under the "80 PLUS" certifications, which span from vanilla 80 PLUS, Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. See Wikipedia for more info.

X2go Remote Linux server/client - JWP | 2013-05-23

 
With x2go you can access your desktop using another computer -- that means both LAN and internet connections. The transmission is done using the ssh protocol, so it is encrypted. By using the free nx libraries from NoMachine, a very acceptable performance in both speed and responsiveness is achieved. Even an ISDN connection runs smoothly. 

This makes it is possible to connect your laptop to any computer with the environment, applications, and performance of the remote desktop. It is also possible to have a bunch of computers connected to a single server (terminal-server, thin-client). 

Clients are available for Linux (Qt4), Windows, and Mac. The latter two can be downloaded directly as binary from the x2go homepage.

The Long Road To Linux - Beeza | 2013-05-21

 
Over about 30 years Beeza has been a software developer and tester, a system designer and technical author. In that time he's worked with a wide range of software, hardware and technologies. From DOS and the early days of Windows and the Mac, through to his conversion to Linux, he's seen great changes in the way we develop software and use computers. Not all the changes have necessarily been for the better, though. 

For anyone who's been around the IT world for a while, this may be a short trip down memory lane. For relative newcomers, it may come as a surprise to discover just how much was achieved years ago with so few resources.

I argue that free of charge is often not what we should be lookiing for if we want good software options. But because I like going the long way around behind the barn to get anywhere, I start off in the Music business.

Doomsday Rule - Charles in NJ | 2013-05-03

HPR Episode: Doomsday Perpetual Calendar Method

What is it?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule  
  (due to John H. Conway, a mathematician born in Liverpool)

  * He's done other research that hackers might like to check out.  
  * Look up the "Game of Life" and "cellular automata".  
  * There may be episodes on these topics, but those should come
      with visualization software.

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway

Game of Life
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
  

Doomsday Rule lets you find the day of the week for any date
  * Dates in history, in immediate past or in future are all good.
  * Works for both the Gregorian and Julian calendar.  
    - I'll only be looking at Gregorian dates for now.
    - Method should work well for dates from 1800 onward.
    - If dates for non-Gregorian calendars are converted to their
        (extrapolated) Gregorian equivalents, this method works.

Wikipedia entry (includes recent optimization):
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_algorithm


Why do this?  It came up in Episode Zero of my "N Days" show on 
calendar counting, where I used it without explanation.

  http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1143


Demos: Check these answers at www.day-calculator.com  
  * Some listeners may now adjourn to the latest Linux Outlaws episode.


Method: Get Century Anchor Day, calculate offset for the year to find
   Doomsday's reference location for current year, find closest 
   reference date to target date, and count off to the answer.

a) Isaac Newton's date of birth: 
   - 25 December 1642 - 1600's Tuesday. 
     Year 42 = 3*12 + 6 and (6/4) = 1. 
     Hence 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 for an offset of 3.
     Tuesday + 3 = Friday.  12/12 is Friday, so 12/26 is Friday
     Newton was born 12/25, so that was a Thursday

b) My grandfather's date of birth:
   - 20 January 1898 - 1800's anchor is Friday.  
     Year 98 = 8*12 + 2, (2/4) = 0.  
     So 8 + 2 + 0 = 10 gives an offset of 3.

   - 1898 wasn't a leap year, so 10 January was Monday 
   - That means 17 January was a Monday, too.
   - So 20 January 1898 was a Thursday.

c) A wedding anniversary that I like to remember: 15 May 2000
   - 2000 has anchor day on Tuesday, and no offset.
   - Rule: "I work 9 to 5 at 7-11", so 9 May (16 May) are on Tuesday.
   - 15 May 2000 was a Monday.  True.  'Twas the day after Mother's Day.
   
d) My parent's wedding day: 19 May 1957
   - 1900 has anchor day Wednesday.  57 = 4*12 + 9 and (9/4) = 2. 
   - So 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 or an offset of 1.
   - 9 May is Thursday, as is 16 May.  The 19th is 3 days later.
   - So 19 May 1957 was a Sunday.


Plan: I'm going to reveal the magic behind this, and introduce some 
mental shortcuts to help you learn to do this in your head.  

If you can master the 12's row in your times tables up to 8 times 12, 
and the 4's row up the 20s or 30s, and you can tell time on a 12-hour 
clock, you should be able to do this.  

We're not in school, so paper and pencil to track the numbers, and 
finger-counting offsets to days of the week are all allowed. 


Explanation:
1. Certain memorable dates fall on the same day of the week as
   "Doomsday" = last day of February, whatever that is.

2. Dates recycle every 400 years, and Doomsday Anchor dates by Century
   are 1600: Tuesday, 1700: Sunday, 1800: Friday, 1900: Wednesday.

3. That's enough, but to simplify mental math notice 12-year cycles.
   - Every completed 12 years pushes the days of the week ahead by +1
   - Each year within the current incomplete cycle adds +1
   - Each leap year in current cycle adds +1 (including current year) 

4. Doomsday dates are:
   a. January 10 and Doomsday (last day of February)
   
   b. Odd months: Add +4 through July, then subtract 4.
      7 March, 9 May, 11 July
      5 September, 7 November
   
   c. Even months are reflexive: 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12


See the attached spreadsheets for examples and annotated calculations.

 - LibreOffice Calc: 229-Charles-in-NJ-Doomsday-Rule-v1.ods
 
 - Excel 5/95 'xls' for LibreOffice or Gnumeric:
     229-Charles-in-NJ-Doomsday-Rule.xls
 
 - Gnumeric: 229-Charles-in-NJ-Doomsday-Rule-v1.gnumeric


Bonus Content:
 - Excel VBA module: 229-Charles-in-NJ-Doomsday-Rule.vbaxl.bas 
     * Import the .bas module
     * Input is an Excel "Date" object
     * Very proprietary formats and code, but some people use it.
 
 - Python:  doomsday.py
     * Contains two functions:  Each returns a string value for the day
          of the week, e.g., "Sunday"
       
       dayOfWeek(year, month, day): Doomsday is last day of February,
          and the (month, day) are converted to relative ordinal dates.
          For leap years, we have to push both Doomsday and any target
          date after 28 February up by one for the leap day.
       
       dayOfWeek2(year, month, day): Doomsday date anchors are computed
           for each month, so leap years require adjustments to the
           anchors for January and February to account for the shift
           in the February ending date.  Later months are fine.

 - Script for GNU 'bc': doomsday.bc is a bc 'port' of the Python code
     * Differences: Return value is a number from 0-6 that represents
         the day of the week by its relative position.
         
       0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, 3 = Wednesday, 
       4 = Thursday, 5 = Friday, 6 = Saturday
 
     * In a shell, run 'bc' with the filename as an argument:
       catintp@Derringer:~$  bc doomsday.bc
       
       - This loads the two functions in the file.  You can invoke them
           within 'bc' like any other function:
           
       dayofweek(1981, 5, 15)
       dayofweek2(1642, 12, 25)
       dayofweek(2013, 11, 22)
       dayofweek2(2059, 5, 19)

 - Alternate Script for GNU 'bc': doomsday2.bc 
     * Return value is still a number from 0-6 that represents
         the day of the week by its relative position.
     
     * Uses a side effect to print a human-friendly answer.   
     
     * English only, but localisation should be easy.

HPR Saturday Sessions: What is hacking? - Nido Media | 2013-05-02


Nido is joined by dude-man, Epicanis, and artv61 to discuss how one could or should define "Hacker" and "Hacking", particularly in reference to the "Hackers" that Hacker Public Radio episodes are intended to be "of interest to". Unfortunately, all participants seemed to be largely in agreement with each other, so there isn't enough contention to make the discussion dramatic. Listeners may find the discussion insightful anyway, and we do come up with some suggestions and ultimately encourage everyone to be a lot more public about using the words "hacker" and "hacking" as much as possible outside the context of criminal and computer-programming activity until outdated dictionaries finally update their definitions.

Although Nido deserves the credit for Saturday Sessions, recording, cleanup, and editing of today's session was done by Epicanis, so if the sound sucks it's all his fault and not Nido's. Same goes for these show notes.

Word processors are overrated - johanv | 2013-05-01


Word processors are overrated. Too often they are used instead of better alternatives. For example: to write a report, to describe a workflow or a vision, a lot of people just grab Microsoft Word. Which is a bad idea. Should you use LibreOffice Writer then? OpenOffice? Maybe Google docs? They are not much better. 

If the focus of your text is on its content, if the structure of your text is important, if the way the text is laid out is less important than the consistency of the lay-out, or if you want to collaborate with other people, you should not use a typical mainstream word processor.

Playing Ingress - Epicanis | 2013-04-24


This is the first of two or maybe three parts on the subject on Ingress, which was released into invitation-only beta-testing by Google in November of 2012.

Ingress is a world-spanning location-based game set in a world somewhere between the real one and a fictional one that is almost exactly like the real one except with space-alien mind control conspiracies.

This episode is purely about "playing the game". The follow-up episode will be more about the underlying technology and things you (and Google) might be able to do with it besides the core gameplay.

There may be a third part if there is enough interest.

A final note - the app version that I mention in the show was upgraded literally about 5 minutes after I finished editing and started to prepare this show for upload. (And, yes, I'm using "literally" correctly - I mean I finished exporting the file from audacity, went to check Google+, and within 300 seconds someone was mentioning that a new version was out). It does seem to resolve some of the problems I mentioned, just as I speculated that it might. I'll follow up on this and any subsequent updates in the followup episode.

Comments and suggestions and demands for more episodes are welcome, nay, encouraged either on this episode's comments at hackerpublicradio.org or on my own blog at http://hpr.dogphilosophy.net . Thanks for listening!

Chromebook Acer C7 Review - Helvetin | 2013-04-18

 
I got into Linux after listening to lots of podcasts during my work commute and I am one of those non-technical people listening that after lots of worrying finally installed Ubuntu and found out that it works pretty easily. A few month ago I got a raspberry pi and played with its Arch Linux version and very recently got the Acer C7 Chromebook and immediately put Chrubuntu on it, which is also how I am recording this. 

So here is my strange problem. I currently have a Swiss-German keyboard layout at work, at the previous job I had an standard US keyboard and I am pretty sure that this chromebook has a UK keyboard. So I needed to find a really fast way to switch at first the UK keyboard layout to the Swissgerman layout and then also have a change to change to the US keyboard easily, because it happens ... you may believe it or not ... that some things I just know where they are in the US layout better than the Swiss layout and vice versa. 

This is not really a problem if you stick with Unity. You go to System Settings, Keyboard Layout and add the relevant. Where are those System settings now? 

setxkbmap is the command. In /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules I found all the layouts (ch for Swiss and us for American layout). I added the option to toggle between ch and us by click both shift keys. So the full command as alias is Swiss='setxkbmap -option 'grp:shifts_toggle' 'ch,us''. To not write the entire thing you can add this as a alias in .bashrc or probably put somewhere in a startup file, so you don't have to worry about it. 

Further configurations and installations: 
•To enable the 2nd screen use command: xrandr --output HDMI1 --auto --right-of LVDS1 
•Change hostname by editing nano /etc/hostname (by default it is Chrubuntu) 
•Install cmatrix just for fun 
•Installations: Desktop Environment openbox, lxde, i3 just to play around - Terminator as terminal emulation - ranger as file manager - s3cmd for offsite backup, although dropbox and spideroak work too (s3cmd works also on raspberry pi) - encryption with encfs and truecrypt

Utilizing Maximum Space on a Cloned BTRFS Partition - FiftyOneFifty | 2013-04-17

 
Utilizing Maximum Space on a Cloned BTRFS Partition

by FiftyOneFifty


1.If you clone a disk to a disk, Clonezilla will increase (decrease) the size of each partition proportional to the relative size of the drives.
1.I wanted to keep my / the same size and have no swap (new drive was SSD), so I did a partion to partion clone instead
2.Created partions on the new SSDs with a GParted Live CD, 12Gb root (Ext4) and the remained for /home, (btrfs, because I planned to move to SSD from the start, and last summer only btrfs supported TRIM)
2.After cloning /dev/sda1 to /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sda2 to /dev/sdb2 using Clonezilla, I inspected the new volumes with the GParted Live CD
1./dev/sdb2 had 40% unaccessable space, i.e., the usable space was the same size as the old /home volume
2.GParted flagged the error and said I could correct it from the menu (Partition->Check) but btrfs doesn't support fschk, so it didn't work
3.Tried shrinking the volume in GParted and re-expanding it to take up the free space, also didn't work.
3.Discovered 'btrfs utility' and that it was supported by the GParted Live CD
1.Make a mount point
1.sudo mkdir /media/btrfs
2.Mount the btrfs volume
1.sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /media/btrfs
3.Use btrfs utility to expand the btrfs file system to the maximun size of the volume
1.sudo btrfs filesystem resize max /media/btrfs
4.Unmount the btrfs volume
1.sudo umount /dev/sdb2
4.Rechecked /dev/sdb2 with GParted, I no longer had unaccessible space

Cinnarch 64 bit, Installation Review - FiftyOneFifty | 2013-04-05


Howdy folks, this is FiftyOneFifty, and today I wanted to talk about my experiences installing the 64 bit version of Cinnarch net edition on a dual core notebook. Cinnarch of course is a relatively new Arch based distro running the Cinnamon fork of Gnome. I had previously installed Arch proper on this notebook, but when I rebooted to the hard drive, I lost the Ethernet connection. This is not uncommon, but there the notebook sat while until I had time to work the problem. I wanted to start using the notebook, and I'd heard good things about Cinnarch, so it seemed like a simple solution. I went into knowing Cinnarch was in alpha, so i shouldn't have been surprised when an update broke the system less then a week after the install, but that comes later in my story.

LinuxFest Northwest is April 27, 28,2013 - David Whitman | 2013-03-28


LinuxFest Northwest is April 27, 28, 2013 - an Interview with Jakob Perry http://linuxfestnorthwest.org 

Series/Tags: Show notes, Jakob Perry, LinuxFest Northwest, beer, Linux, Bellingham, Bellingham Technical College, Bellingham Linux Users Group 

An interview with Jakob Perry by David Whitman 

LinuxFest Nothwest is to be held April 27, 28, 2013 

Website is http://linuxfestnorthwest.org 

Plan to attend if you can. 

LinuxFest Northwest is an annual event produced by the Bellingham Linux Users Group, and volunteers from other northwest U.S. open source users groups. It is held on the campus of Bellingham Technical College (directions at the BTC website under ABOUT BTC). The Fest features Linux and open source experts and aficionados sharing their experience and enthusiasm with a wide variety of free and open source technologies. 

This generally means that there will be a lot of smart people who come with something to share and a desire to learn. This is a low cost/high value event that's held on a weekend, so there are also folks who don't usually go to commercial conferences. All in all, it's a lot of fun with fresh faces on eager people.

Icecast 101 - klaatu | 2013-03-19


Klaatu talks about how to set up Icecast, new Ices, old Ices, and a nice little (simple) HTML5 player. This is part one of a two-part series. 

Here are the raw commands for Icecast, Ices, and Ices-cc: 
#start the streaming server
icecast -c /etc/icecast.xml -B

#start the mp3 stream
ices-cc -c /etc/ices-cc.conf -F /home/dj/playlist.txt -R -b 96 -m mp3 -P radio

# start the ogg stream
ices /etc/ices/ices-playlist.xml


Here is the code for the simple HTML5 player that Klaatu mentions in the episode. It's straight HTML5 but in case you're new to HTML5 then this could be useful: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
    <title>My Great Streaming Server Example dot Com</title>
</head>
<div id="player">
<audio width="100px" height="200px" autoplay loop controls autobuffer preload="auto">
      <source src="http://example.com:8000/mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
      <source src="http://example.com:8000/ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>
</div>
  </body>
</html>


Klaatu is indebted to Kwisher, Delwin, and Ruji for their help on this series.

Resolving Issues (The Vhost Config File) - NYbill and Windigo | 2013-03-18


Windigo helps NYbill as he trys to set up mutiple servers on his VPS by explaining the stucture of the vhost file. 
NameVirtualHost *:80

#this first virtualhost enables: http://127.0.0.1, or: http://localhost, 
#to still go to /srv/http/*index.html(otherwise it will 404_error).
#the reason for this: once you tell httpd.conf to include extra/httpd-vhosts.conf, 
#ALL vhosts are handled in httpd-vhosts.conf(including the default one),
# E.G. the default virtualhost in httpd.conf is not used and must be included here, 
#otherwise, only domainname1.dom & domainname2.dom will be accessible
#from your web browser and NOT http://127.0.0.1, or: http://localhost, etc.

templer: a static html generator - Chess Griffin | 2013-03-13


In today's show Chess talks to us about a static html generator written in perl called templer 
•https://github.com/skx/templer
•http://www.steve.org.uk/

Templer

Templer is yet another static site generator, written in Perl.

It makes use of the HTML::Template module for performing variable expansion within pages and layouts, along with looping and conditional-statement handling.

Templer has evolved over time for my own personal use, but I believe it is sufficiently generic it could be useful to others.

My motivation for putting it together came from the desire to change several hand-made, HTML-coded, sites to something more maintainable such that I could easily change the layout in one place.

The design evolved over time but the key reason for keeping it around is that it differs from many other simple static-generators in several ways:
•You may define global variables for use in your pages/layouts.
•A page may define and use page-specific variables.
•You may change the layout on a per-page basis if you so wish. ◦This was something that is missing from a lot of competing tools.

•Conditional variable expansion is supported, via HTML::Template.
•File contents, shell commands, and file-globs may be used in the templates ◦This allows the trivial creation of galleries, for example.
◦These are implemented via plugins.

•You may also embed perl code in your pages.

Another key point is that the layouts allow for more than a single simple "content" block to be placed into them - you can add arbitrary numbers of optional side-menus, for example.

Although this tool was written and used with the intent you'd write your site-content in HTML you can write your input pages in Textile or Markdown if you prefer (these inputs are supported via plugins).

CJE Computer Jargon Explained 01 - b1ackcr0w | 2013-03-08


I had an idea for a website that aims to explain as clearly as possible, computing and internet terms that confuse and frustrate people. 

It came about when a Motorsport Forum Website I work with changed their IP address and some DNS issues caused problems. In the discussion amongst the staff of the site, as soon as the technically minded staff talked about DNS and IPs and Caches, some of the staff who aren't as familiar with the terms either dropped out or even got angry because they felt they were being excluded. 

That highlighted to me the need for a resource where these terms could be explained in a way that demystifies the jargon for the every man. I am thinking it could be massively useful to have a site where we can use short video files to quickly and effectively explain the who,why,where,when and what of computerspeak, that would otherwise baffle and deter friends, family and colleagues. 

This idea is little more than a concept at this time. As I make progress towards getting CJA working, I shall post updates on http://amunro.net 

If you have any comments, suggestions for topics to explain, or if you want to contribute to the site. Please email me or get in touch through amunro.net.

Old Time Radio on the web - Frank Bell | 2013-03-07


Frank Bell talks about Old Time Radio (OTR), his history as a radio listener, and his Old Time Radio websites. 

The OTR Fans site defines OTR as "Old time radio often called "OTR" refers to radio shows from the early days of radio broadcasting. The term usually applies to dramas, comedies, mystery shows, westerns and variety shows that were acted out by professional actors and sent out over the airwaves. In the golden age of radio families would sit around their radio listening to the exciting shows the way we sit around our television sets watching them today."

Distractionless Writing - Thistleweb | 2013-03-01


ThistleWeb explains the advantages of a distractionless writing environment for fiction writers or aspiring fiction writers. A physical space of sanctuary is only the first part of the concept, but that's undone if your screen around your text is full of distractions. A distractionless writing application covers the entire screen, separating you from updates, notifications and editing options. ThistleWeb's distractionless environment of choice is Focuswriter, although there's quite a few to choose from.

Copying a Printer Definition File Between Systems - FiftyOneFifty | 2013-02-28



 I recently learned where Linux stores the PPD created when you set up a printer and how to copy it between PCs.  I'd like to briefly share that information with you.

 This is how to copy a printer definition file (equivalent of a printer driver) from a system where the printer is already configured to another system that you want to be able to access the same printer.  Reasons you might need to do this:

 a.  The normal CUPS (Common Unified Printing System) set up doesn't have the right definition file for your printer.  In rare instances, you might have to download a ppd from the manufacturer or another source.  If so, copying the ppd may be easier than downloading it again.

b.  You configure CUPS and find there are no pre-provided printer drivers.  I thought this was the case when I first tried to configure CUPS under Linaro on my ODroidX.   For all intents and purposes, Linaro is an Arm port of mainline Ubuntu (Unity included).  I installed CUPS via Aptitude and tried to configure a printer as I would on any Linux system.  When I got to printer selection, the dropdown to select a manufacturer (the next step would be to choose a model) was greyed out, as was the field to enter a path to a ppd file.  I closed the browser and tried again, and the same thing happened.  This is what prompted me to find out where to find a PPD file on another system and copy it.  I never got to see how it would work, because when I had the ppd file copied over and ready to install, the manufactures and models in CUPS were already populated.  There had bee an update between my first and second attempts to configure CUPS on the ODroidX, but I'd rather say it was a glitch the first time, instead of the ppd's suddenly showing up in the repo.

 c.  When I installed Arch on another system, I found there was far less options for choosing models, in my instance, there was only one selection for HP Deskjets.  I suspect borrowing the model specific ppd from another distro will increase the functionality of the printer.

 Copying the ppd

 1.  On the computer where the printer is already configured, find the .ppd (Postscript Printer Definition) file you generated (filename will be the same as the printer name) in /etc/cups/ppd/model (or possibly just /etc/cups/ppd, neither my ODroidX or my Fedora laptop have the "model" folder).
 2. Copy to your home folder on the new system (You can't place the file in it's final destination yet, unless you are remoted in as root)
 3. According to the post I found on LinuxQuestions.org, CUPS looks for a GZipped file [ gzip -c myprinter.ppd > myprinter.ppd.gz ; the '-c' arguement creates a new file, rather than gzipping the old one, and you use redirection to generate the new file.]  Recall that I never got to try this, because when I re-ran CUPS, the printer selections were already populated.  
 4. Copy the archived file to /etc/cups/ppd/model on the machine that needs the printer driver

 Configure CUPS (IP Printer)
 1. Open localhost:631 in a browser
 2. Click Administration tab
 3. Click "Add a Printer" button
 4. Log in as an account with root priviledges
 5. For Ethernet printers, select "AppSocket/HP JetDirect" button and click "Continue"
 6. From the examples presented, " socket://PRINT_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:9100  " works for me, click continue
 7. On the next page, fill in a printer name, this will be the file name for the PPD generated as well as how the printer is labled in the printer select dialog.  The other fields are optional.  Click continue.
 8. (I am assuming if the LinuxQuestions post was right, CUPS will find the gz file and show the manuafacturer and model as options) From the list, select a manufacturer, or input the path to your PPD file
 9. Select the printer model
 9a.I think you could copy over the ppd as is and type the path to it in the field where it asks for a ppd file.  
 10.Modify or accept the default printer settings

 Or just copy the ppd and compare the settings in /etc/cups/printers.conf

Chris Conder Catchup on Broadband for Rural North - Ken Fallon | 2013-02-27


#da12bb #HPR
 In todays show Ken catches up with Chris Conder of the Broadband for Rural North (http://b4rn.org.uk/). We interviewed her back in episode 980 (http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0980)
A big line of people with spades 

Located in the very pretty but the rural Forest of Bowland in Lancashire in the UK, and tired of putting up with slow ''broadband'' they decided to put together their own network. They tried shared wifi, 3 and 4G mobile networks, MMDS and Satellite yet all proved to be unreliable. 

So over tea and cake they came up with a plan. 
•A 240 Kilometer (150 mile) plan.
•A 1 gigabit (1000mb/sec) fiber optic connection plan.
•A let''s give a connection to every one of the 1700 homes, farms, schools, churches and businesses, in the area plan
And while they were at it they designed it to be: •redundant with a dual homed backbone direct to the UK''s Internet exchange
•upgradeable with ducts large enough to take multiple fibers
•laid through some of the most rugged, mountainous area of Lancashire to get to the people that need it most. (And let''s be clear here, nothing to do with the fact that they will need to use dynamite to blast their way through the rocks.)

Installing Linux without a monitor - Various Hosts | 2013-02-14


Two weeks ago we aired a show about the Sonar Project which is a specialized GNU/Linux distribution to develop and proof accessibility in a modern distribution. This is a test bed and so every single enhancement and discovery will be sent back upstream so that all distributions will be accessible by default. 

 The Sonar Project show was downloaded a total of 14,219 times so far and yet only 127 people have donated.   

Today it's a case of the blind leading the (simulated) blind as Jonathan Nadeau walks pokey through an install of the Sonar GNU/Linux distribution without a monitor. 

So listen along and experience what life is like if you are a blind hacker. 
Press PAUSE to hear what it would be like if Jonathan had not done so much work already.

Mumble Audio Issues - Delwin | 2013-02-11


I had a couple of requests for more specific information regarding audio quality in mumble, so here I go through a few of the more common audio issues I've run into with a few tips about what you can try to do about them. These issues are: overdriven audio, quiet audio, distorted audio and choppy audio. 

Eve bot (http://frymaster.127001.org/mumble) is also mentioned as an alternative to using the loopback settings within mumble for troubleshooting. 

Thanks to Peter64 for his help with generating the choppy audio segment.

Intro to editing the Open Street Map - pokey | 2013-02-04


I'm going to call this an experimental episode. It's a tutorial on eding the Open Street Map at http://www.openstreetmap.org/ . By all rights, this should have been done as a screen cast, but since I have no interest in doing a screen cast, we're going to try something different. For this episode to work, I'll need your cooperation, and for it to make any sence to you, you'll need to be signed into http://www.openstreetmap.org/ . So go ahead and create an account over there (or begin the password reset process) while you're downloading this audio file. You're going to need an account if you want to edit anyway, so I'm not asking for anything you wouldn't be doing anyway. You may find it helpful to have a second tab open to http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features . It won't be much help while listening to the episode, but it is very helpful while editing in general. 

Some people enjoy finding mistakes. For their enjoyment I have included a few.

how to start irssi in screen after reboot - Lord Drachenblut | 2013-02-01


In this episode Lord Drachenblut shows us how to start irssi in screen after reboot. 
crontab -e # opens editor for crontab 
@reboot /usr/bin/screen -dmUS irc /usr/bin/irssi


-d -m Start screen in "detached" mode. This creates a new session but doesn't attach to it. This is useful for system startup scripts.

A few things I forgot to mention in the episode. The muriatic acid/hydrogen peroxide etching solution can be used multiple times. Store it in plastic or glass containers. The tinting fluid can also be reused. But, it will need to be agitated and or slightly heated (place container in a bath of hot water) before reuse as the mix will settle out.

Tech and Loathing 13 - Remote Desktop Protocols - KFive | 2013-01-28


Today we are doing the last show that has been in the syndicated Thursday queue for a long time. Now that we are no longer syndicating shows, I wanted to post this today so that we can get the backlog cleared. 

The show can be found at http://techandloathing.info/2012/11/tnl-episode-13-remote-desktop-protocols/ 

Hey listeners, another episode of Tech & Loathing is now on tap. A couple of IRC friends have joined me tonight to discuss a couple of topics. For Loathing we have Android vs. iOS and all of my frustrations with the world of mobile computing. For Tech we have a look at RDP, VNC and running applications and desktop environments remotely, either securely via SSH or VPN or insecurely using X Forwarding and other techniques. Hope everyone enjoys the show.

Kernels in the Boot, or What to Do When Your /boot folder Fills Up - FiftyOneFifty | 2013-01-22


Synopsis of the Problem

 You may hae heard me mention that I purchased a used rack server a couple years ago to help teach myself Linux server administration.  It's an HP DL-380 G3 with dual single core Zeons and 12Gb of RAM.  It came with two 75Gb SCSI drives in RAID1, dedicated to the OS.  Since the seller wanted more for additional internal SCSI drives, and those old server drives are limited to 120Gb anyway, I plugged in a PCI-X SATA adapter and connected  750Gb drive externally and mounted it as /home.  I moved over the 2Gb USB drive I had on my Chumby (as opposed to transferring the files) and it shows up as /media/usb0.  I installed Ubuntu server 10.04 (recently updated to 12.04) because CentOS didn't support the RAID controller out of the box and I had frustrated the lack of support for up to date packages on Debian Lenny on the desktop. 

 With 75Gb dedicated to the OS and application packages, you can imaging my surprise when after a update and upgrade, I had a report that my /boot was full.  It was until I look at the output from fdisk that I remembered the Ubuntu installer created a separate partition for /boot.  At the risk of oversimplifying the purpose of /boot, it is where your current and past kernel files are stored.  Unless the system removes older kernels (most desktop systems seem to) the storage required for /boot will increase with every kernel upgrade. 

This is the output of df before culling the kernels

The Solution I Found
I ran accross some articles that suggested I could use 'uname -r' to identify my current running kernel (3.2.0-31, the -32 apparently kernel ran out of space before it completed installing) and just delete the files with other numbers.  That didn't seem prudent, and fortunately I've found what seems to be a more elegant solution on upubuntu.com .
http://www.upubuntu.com/2011/11/how-to-remove-unused-old-kernels-on.html




Verify your current running kernel

 uname -r

 Linux will often keep older kernels so that you can boot into and older version from Grub (at least on a desktop).  Fedora has an enviroment setting to tell the OS just how many old kernels you want to maintain [installonly_limit in /etc/yum.conf].  Please leave a comment if you know of an analog in Debian/Ubuntu.  


List the kernels currently installed on you system.  

 dpkg --list | grep linux-image


Cull all the kernels but the current one
The next line is the key, make sure you copy and paste exaclty from the shownotes.  I'm not much good with regular expressions, but I can see it's trying to match all the packages starting with 'linux-image' but containing a number string different from the one returned by 'uname -r', and remove those packages.  Obviously, this specific commandwill only work with Debian/Ubuntu systems, but you shoild be able to adapt it to your distro.  The '-P' is my contribution, so you can see what packages you are eliminating before the change becomes final.

 sudo aptitude -P purge ~ilinux-image-\[0-9\]\(\!`uname -r`\)


Make sure Grub reflects your changes
Finally, the author recomends running 'sudo update-grub2'  to make sure Grub reflects your current kernel status (the above command sees to do this after every operation anyway, but better safe than sorry.

 It's worth noting I still don't have my -32 kernel update, so I'll let you know if the is anything reqired to get kernel updatesget started again.

 My df now shows 14%  usage in /boot and a directory listing on /boot only  shows the current kernel files.

PAM Two Factor Auth SSH - Beto | 2013-01-13


Thank you to Broke For Free and for their Creative Commons album Broke For Free: Slam Funk, which was used during this latest show at HackerPublicRadio.org 



Good sources of information for PAM
•http://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-pam.html
•http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication




Overview of PAM Security
•Definition: Presenting two or more from something you have, something you know, and something you are.
•Centos /etc/pam.d/
•Debian /etc/pam.d/ (common-auth exists in Debian and its a system wide security implementation for all pam.d applications)




Google Two Factor Authentication
•MNXSolutions.com,Old instructions but still useful
• Webbynode.com, Useful but still uses outdated mercurial steps
•Google two factor auth git repo source



General Instructions
Install git, gcc, and make on your system •$ apt-get install git make gcc
•$ yum install git make gcc

 Execute git command as noted on google's site: •$ git clone https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/

 Compile and install the google two factor auth PAM module and application •$ cd google-authenticator/libpam/
•$ make install

	Add the following lines to the /etc/pam.d/sshd •auth required pam_google_authenticator.so

 Location of SSH server configurations •/etc/ssh/sshd_config

 Add/modify the following stanza to SSH server configuration: •ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes

 Create Google two factor profile for SSH user and answer the setup questions based off your preferences •$ google-authenticator

 Restart SSH server •$ service ssh restart (on CENTOS try $ service sshd restart)




Wrap Up
•In Debian based systems you can comment out the system wide common-auth by simply adding a # to the beginning of the @include common-auth.
•If you want to use google two auth with other applications simply add it to the appropriate /etc/pam.d/ file
•Other useful PAM modules include the Barada module: libpam-barada (OTP with Android Client), pam_winbind (Samba Active Directory authentication module), and many more.
•Make sure you have dual SSH connections and are sudo or su as a privileged user. Also make sure any files you configure today are backed up before you edit them. 
•When setting up Two Factor Auth profiles, go into cleanup mode to ensure you don't use the QR code url where it can be later retrieved from your url history. Also make sure you cleanup your command line and clipboard history so that emergency scratch codes and secret keys can't be found by wondering eyes.

Podcasts worth mentioning.
•Linux Outlaws
•Network Security Podcast
•Risky Business Podcast

Food - Health - Nutrially Densce food - Dude-man | 2013-01-10


Part 1 of ...I Love Food, Good Food

A Contribution for HPR from Dude-man@dudmanovi.cz where he talks about a not so well known, but very well thought out and backed up by scientific research started in the 1930's by Weston A Price, who went on after traveling around the world to find healthy people and study what made them healthy to write a large book describing in a language understadable to the lay person what he discovered along with its significance in our own lifes should we wish to maximize our health and that of our children and future generations. Of course the first question we should have is what does a healthy person look like, the shape and size, the condition of the teath etc. 

Dude-man does his best to share a little of what he's learnt over the last 10 years which he's been putting into practice with his wife, son (7), daughter (2) and their small homestead of Jersey dairy cows and other aniamsl which help provide the staff of live to the whole family.

Hacking Karma And Reincarnation With The Forgiveness Discipline - deepgeek | 2012-12-28

I recently ran an educational event for a society concerned with Mysticism 
and as such, gave the first speech. I recorded it "on the fly," so there 
are problems with the recording, and I had to cut a few comments that 
were too soft to be picked up at all by my head-mounted microphone. 

What follows is the script I wrote for the first three-quarters of the 
presentation.

==================================================================

The first thing to understand is that we are not really discussing the 
traditional idea of forgiveness.  We are talking about a whole new 
ballgame. This really is not your parents idea of forgiveness.  Let's 
have an example of old-school forgiveness.

"Well, you really did it. This is a real, and a really bad, situation, 
and it happens to be your fault. But I'm going to forgive you for what 
you did. You don't deserve this, but I'm just so much more perfect than you, 
I'm going to do this anyway. Because I have Jesus. By the way, you don't.
And you will always be screwing up. You could stop screwing up, but 
you wont. Because your not as great a person as I am. You could begin 
to agree with me about everything, but you won't. You could even 
believe every last thing I believe. But you won't. So, unlike me, 
there is no hope of you going to heaven. I will, but you wont. And 
I might not look sad about this, but I really do feel sorry for you."

Development Discussion - Dave Morriss | 2012-12-26


I am trying to write a script which will implement the scheduling rules for HPR. I spoke to Ken Fallon about this, and where it would fit in the overall design of the HPR system, when we met up at OggCamp 2012 in August, but we didn't manage to resolve very much. So, recently Ken and I began a discussion over Mumble to try and make progress. A few minutes in we decided to record our discussion for posterity, and this is the result. 

The notes which I had sent Ken before our Mumble session are available in PDF format.

Who Owns Your Files - Ahuka | 2012-12-20


Indie and Creative Commons
•Soundcloud - This is a music and audio sharing site, primarily.
•Free Music Archive - Lots of CC-licensed music.
•Jamendo - One of the premiere CC music sites.
•Bandcamp - I just learned about this site from my friend Craig Maloney, who does the Open Metal Cast. This site has Creative Commons music from bands who want to build a relationship with their fans and sell them music. Good artists like Amanda Palmer are here.

e-Books
When it comes to books, you really are at the mercy of the individual publishers. Most music labels have finally come to accept that no DRM is the best way to go, but must book publishers are still being dragged into the 21st century kicking and screaming. But there are some good places to find e-books that respect your freedom. •Project Gutenberg - This is the granddaddy of the DRM free book sites. Project Gutenberg makes available books that are in the Public Domain, i.e., where the copyright has run out. These are mainly older books, but a lot of classics are in here. They make books available in all of the major formats.
•Baen Books - This publisher specializes in the harder Science Fiction, but they really understand the new media landscape. They not only offer most of their books DRM-free and in multiple formats, but they also have the Baen Free Library, where they offer selected books free of charge. The hope is that with the first taste free, you will want to buy more. And it works. I went there to see what they had, discovered that they had the entire collected works of one of my favorite authors (James H. Schmitz) for sale, and bought the lot of them.
•Tor/Forge - A major publisher in the Science Fiction and Fantasy fields, they just moved to going DRM free a few months ago. They did this because other publishers had been successful in so doing.
•Angry Robot - Along with Baen, a pioneer in selling DRM-free books in the Science Fiction and Fantasy fields.
•Avon Romance - A major publisher of romance novels, they just announced that they are experimenting with DRM-free ebook sales.
•O'Reilly Media - The premiere publisher of technical books, they pretty get everything right. They sell e-books without DRM. When a new edition of a book you already bought comes out you can "upgrade" for a nominal fee (e.g. I upgraded my Kevin Purdy "Android" book for $1). And with older books that they think are no longer worth in print, they are removing the copyright and making them freely available.
•ManyBooks.net - This site has a lot of overlap with Project Gutenberg, but also has some newer works that have been made available, such as Charles Stross's Accelerando.
•Fictionwise - Although heavy on the Science Fiction and Fantasy, has a lot of offerings in other genres as well. Reasonably priced and DRM-free.
•Cory Doctorow - Cory was one of the first authors to make a point of offering all of his works not only DRM-free but free of charge in e-book formats from his Web site. But you know, when the book he co-authored with Charles Stross Rapture of the Nerds came out recently I went to the Google Play store and bought it.
•DriveThru Fiction - An interesting site that also has Comics and RPG games available.
•Apress - A publisher of technical books that also offers reduced-price e-books if you have already purchased the print title. This is something I'd like to see more of.
•Packt Publishing - Another technical book publisher with DRM-free books.

Audiobooks
This is where there is still a big disappointment. Audible, which is by any measure the clear leader here, insists on DRM on all of their books, which is why I refuse to get an account. Audible is now owned by Amazon, which sells music tracks as MP3 files without DRM, so there was hope when they bought Audible that we could get DRM-free audiobooks, but that was not the case. Fortunately, there are alternatives. •eMusic - This is the same site I mentioned above for DRM-free musci tracks. They also offer a subscription plan for audiobboks, $10 a month gets you one book. Selection is not as good as Audible, but their list is growing all of the time and I have had no trouble finding books there that interest me. I recently listened to Walter Isaacson's biogrpahy of Albert Einstein through a book I bought here.
•Podiobooks - This site offers audiobooks in serialized form, much like podcasts offer you a file every week. Heavy on the Science Fiction and Fantasy at this point, but worth checking out. Scott Sigler and J.C. Hutchins are both available here, for instance.
•Scott Sigler - Scott used free content to get his name out, but still offers free audio versions on his web site even though he now has a publisher.
•Cory Doctorow - Cory in addition to offering free ebooks also offers audiobooks that are DRM-free on a "name your own price" basis. Among the readers on his books are Neil Gaiman, Wil Wheaton, Spider Robinson, and Leo Laporte. He even sells files and CDs in Ogg format if you prefer to get your files that way. Due seriously gets freedom, but if you know anything about Cory Doctorow you know that.

The N Days of Christmas? Intro to Recreational Math - Charles in NJ | 2012-12-19

Hacker Public Radio: 206 203 5729

The N Days of Christmas? Intro to Recreational Math
Part Zero: Calendar Counting

First episode of HPR that contains a direct discussion of a math topic.
 - Episode 479 Ohio Linux Fest, Klaatu interviews DWick about math 
      software for Linux
      
 - Episode 523 Using Petunia software to teach math


Inspired by a traditional song that is proof that some songs do not
   need to be recorded by William Shatner to be annoying.
 - Repetitive and formulaic
 - Involves a lot of counting, and that's our focus here. 
 
 
What is the 12 Days of Christmas?
 - Starts on Christmas Day, runs through the day before the next Season
 - Hint: That's 'Epiphany', which starts January 6.
 - Counting calendar days comes hard, so we tend to use our fingers
 - Turns out that using our fingers is quite mathematical. Here's why.
 
Finger Counting: How do I count Twelve Days?
 - Let's start easy, with the fingers on one hand. My hands have five.
 - To name the Five Days of New Years is easy: January 1-5 
 
 - What about the Five Days of Christmas?
        Physical way                   General way
   * Christmas Day gets 1 (thumb)     Dec 25 is one day after Dec 24
   * Dec 26 gets 2 (index)            26 - 24 = 2 days
   * Dec 27 gets 3 (salute finger)    27 - 24 = 3 days
   * Dec 28 gets 4 (ring)             28 - 24 = 4 days
   * Dec 29 gets 5 (pinky)            29 - 24 = 5 days
 
 - Notice that counting 5 days, starting with Dec 25, is the same
     as numbering the days after Dec 24 (Christmas Eve).
   * In math, we call this "1-1 correspondence with natural numbers"
   * Math can give you the same certainty as using your fingers.  
   * But it handles larger problems, because you don't run out.
 
 - Example: I'm booked to speak on Day 4 of a 5-day conference
   * Starts on the 25th of the month
   * When do I have to show up?
     - Wrong: Add 4 to first day (25), and arrive a day late.
     - Correct: Add 4 to date of pre-registration cocktail party (24),
          and arrive on time.
      
 - OK. Back to Twelve Days of Christmas.  
   * The labeling approach tells us that December can hold only the 
       first seven of the Twelve Days of Christmas, 
   * December 31 - December 24 gives me 7 days.
 
 
 Partitioning: Adding hands full of additional fingers as needed
  - How do we handle the case where we go into the next month?
  - Key insight: Running out of December days for the Twelve Days is 
       like running out of fingers on one hand when we count to 8.
  - We are so good at counting on our fingers that we don't recognize 
       the act of partitioning the number 8 between our two hands.
    *  Left hand gets 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
    *  Right hand picks up 6, 7 and 8 by mapping them to fingers 1,2,3.

  - To count even higher, we could:
      1) keep borrowing other people's hands, or
      2) track the number of times we reuse our two hands as we go
    
    * First method mirrors calendar math ("Annexing" hands, or months)
    * Second is positional notation ("base 10" and all that)


Back to the Twelve Days
 - I have Twelve Days: 1, 2, ... 12 to assign to dates, even though I 
     may only be interested in the first and last dates right now.
   * Start: How many can I fit into December?
   * December 31st is last. It gets assigned 31 - 24, or 7. 
   * By "finger math", that means I have mapped 7 of the Twelve Days
   * That leaves 12 - 7, or 5 days into January.
 
 - Who can tell me which days are assigned in January? Anyone?
   * That's right, Ken.  January 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
   * So the Twelve Days of Christmas runs 25 December to 5 January 


Question: What if there were 72 Days of Christmas?  When would it end?
 - Note: Don't worry.  This is purely hypothetical.

 - Let's attack this with finger math, with partitioning and annexing
   * December, as we have seen, accounts for 7 days: 25 through 31
   * That leaves 72 - 7, or 65 days
   * January easily picks up 31 days: 1 to 31, leaving 65 - 31 = 34 days
   * February can handle either 28 days, or 29 on a leap year.
   * This leaves us either 5 or 6 days into March

 - Final Answer: 72 Days of Christmas would run from Christmas until the
     following March 5 (leap year), or March 6 (all other years).
   * On Day 73, everyone would enter treatment for Christmas overdose.

Let's check the answer: Day 72 would end ten weeks and 2 days after 
   the opening cocktail party (Monday). So Day 72 should be Wednesday.
   * Next year is not a leap year, so last day is March 6.
   * By the Doomsday perpetual calendar method, Feb 28 is Thursday.
   
   Doomsday method: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule
   
   * So March 7 is Thursday, and March 6 is Wednesday.
   * It worked.
 
Why should I bother with Calendar Math?
 - I learn to look for ways to partition hard problems into easier ones.
 - I learn the same skills that I'll need to debug "off-by-one" errors
     and other boundary violations, which kill you in C programs.
 - I will never miss a speaking engagement, as long as I count my 
     Conference Days from the cocktail party, not from the Keynote.


Next episode: Part One
  Counting partridges and gold rings with Pascal
  - Warning: There will be two semi-magic formulas at the end.
  - I'll show you an easy way to do running sums in a spreadsheet.
  - You can skip the formulas, and I'll never know.
  - Since this is HPR, not school.  We can look up the formulas.

Link to Getting started




http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide





This Beginners' guide will show you how to add data to OpenStreetMap. Tutorials are available in many languages which you can select from the table at the top of this page. 

You need a computer connected to the Internet and some time to gather information and then enter it. A GPS unit and connecting cable are purely optional, but will be required if you want to collect data that way. Given the excellent aerial photography available in the editors these days a GPS is less important than in the early days of the project. 
•
Create a free account so that you can contribute. 

•
Collect data using a GPS unit or by other methods. 

•
Upload GPS data (skip this section if you are not using GPS). 

•
Edit maps to make changes to OpenStreetMap. 

•
Edit data, add tags and upload changes. 

•
See your changes on the map. 

•
Finally, there is a page of additional resources and next steps including some other excellent tutorials. 


The data you add to OpenStreetMap improves the free world map for everyone, whether it's a small correction or thousands of roads added over time. Thank you for making OpenStreetMap just that bit better! 

There is a panel on the right of every page of the tutorial. The page you are on will be in bold text and you can move to any other page by clicking on the relevant page title. The bottom of each page has 'next' and 'previous' links, as appropriate, to take you through the tutorial page by page.

Inspirational stories told on the road

A few months ago I went on a longer trip, alone in my car. As many podcasters before me, I decided to record an episode. An episode I almost immediatly forgot about. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, when I once again found the recording. It sounded quite bad, but after som sound wizardry I think it can pass for an HPR show. The content is where it's at, after all.

TermDuckEn aptsh - screen - guake - FiftyOneFifty | 2012-11-07


I recently discovered apt shell (aptsh), a psuedo shell which gives users of distributions which use apt for package management quick access to the functionality of apt-get. You should find aptsh in the repositories of Debian based distros. Once installed, you can launch 'aptsh' as root from the command prompt (i.e. 'sudo aptsh').




One of the drawbacks of installing software from the terminal is that sometimes you don't know the exact name of the package you want to install. From the aptsh> prompt, 'ls' plus a search string will show all the packages that have that string in their names. You can type 'install' plus a partial package name and use TAB completion to finish the instruction. The function of the 'update' and 'upgrade' commands are self explanatory, unfortunately, you can't string them together on the same line like you can in bash:




sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y safe-upgrade 




Instead, you use the backtick [ ` ] key to put aptsh into queue mode. In queue mode, you can enter commands one by one to be launched in sequence at a later time. To bring your system up to date, you could run:




aptsh> ` 

* aptsh> update 

* aptsh> upgrade 

* aptsh> ` 

aptsh> queue-commit-say yes 




Backtick toggles queue entry, and queue-commit runs the queue. “queue-commit-say y” tells aptsh to answer in the affirmative to any queries from the commands executed in the queue in much the same way “apt-get -y safe-upgrade” confirms software updates without user interaction. Apt shell is capable of other apt related tasks, but I think I've covered the most useful ones.




The trouble with running aptsh is that unless you start it in a terminal with the computer and leave it running all day (as opposed to opening it as a new shell within you terminal every time you want to update or install), despite the convienience of package name search and TAB completion, it really won't save you any keystrokes. With that in mind, I started looking for ways to have the apt shell available at a keystroke (we will leave the wisdom of leaving a shell open with a subset of root privileges for another day). I had guake installed, but rarely used it because I usually have multiple terminal tabs open since I am logged into my server remotely. [Actually, I had forgotten guake supports tabbed terminals quite well. You can open a new tab with <Shift><Ctrl>T and switch between terminal tabs by <Ctrl><PgUp> and <Ctrl><PgDn> or clicking buttons that appear at the bottom of the guake window. I had how, forgotten this until doing further research on this story. Since this revelation ruins my story, we will forget about tabbed terminal support in guake and not mention it again.]




I am also going to assume everyone is familiar with guake. If not, suffice it to say guake is a terminal that pops down in the top third of the screen when you hit a hotkey, <F12> being the default. It returns to the background when you press <F12> again or click the lower part of the desktop. It is patterned after the command shell in the game Quake that let you input diagnostic and cheat codes, hence the name. Since I wasn't using guake as a terminal anyway, I wanted to see if I could make it run apt shell by default. I found you can access guake's graphical configuration manager by right clicking inside the open terminal and selecting preferences. 




On the first preferences tab, I found “command interpreter”, but since aptsh is only a pseudo shell, it isn't found in the dropdown list. However, one option was “screen”, which would give me a way to run multiple terminals that I thought guake lacked. Next, I had to look up how to configure screen. I figured there must be a way to make screen run aptsh in one session by default, and I found it. In the show notes I've included my .screenrc file from my home folder, which I make with the help of this article from the online Red Hat Magazine: 

http://magazine.redhat.com/2007/09/27/a-guide-to-gnu-screen/




**




hardstatus alwayslastline 

hardstatus string '%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{B}%Y-%m-%d %{W}%c %{g}]' 

# Default screens 

screen -t shell1 0 

screen -t apt-shell 1 sudo aptsh 

screen -t server 2 ssh 5150server

screen -t laptop 3 ssh 5150@Redbook 




**




The first two lines set up the screen status line, the first puts it at the bottom of the terminal, the second sets up the status line to display the hostname and date, and an indicator that highlights which screen windows you are looking at. The # Default screens section below sets up sessions screen opens by default. The first line opens up a regular terminal named “shell1” and assigns it to session zero. The second opens a window called “apt-shell” (this is how it's identified on the status line) and launches apt shell. The last two log me into my server (host name aliasing made possible by configuring my homefolder/.ssh/config , thanks Ken Fallon) and my laptop running Fedora respectively. I still have to cycle through your screen windows and type in my passwords for sudo and ssh. The configuration could be set up to launch any bash command or script by default. The cited article doesn't include any more configuration tips, but I'm certain there are ways to set up other options, such as split windows by default. 




Since I also run screen on my remote connection to my server, I have to remember the command prefix is <Crtl>a,a. Ergo, if I want to move to the next window in the screen session (running under guake) on the local PC, the command is <Ctrl>a, then n. To go to the next screen window in the screen session on my server, running inside another screen session on my local PC, it's <Ctrl>a,a,n. 




So, that's how I learned to run apt shell inside screen inside guake. I can be contacted at FiftyOneFifty@linuxbasement.com or by using the contact form on TheBigRedSwitch.DrupalGardens.Com

Of Fuduntu, RescaTux (or the Farmer Buys a Dell) - FiftyOneFifty | 2012-10-29


This is another one of my How I Did It Podcasts (or How I Done It if you rather) where my goal is to pass along the things I learn as a common Linux user administering my home computers and network, and engaging in the types of software tinkering that appeals to our sort of enthusiast.




I'd been thinking for a while about replacing the small computer on my dinner table. I had been using an old HP TC1000, one of the original active stylus Windows tablets, of course now upgraded to Linux. With the snap in keyboard, it had a form factor similar to a netbook, with the advantage that all the vulnerable components were behind the LCD, up off the table and away from spills. It had served my purpose of staying connected to IRC during mealtimes, and occasional streaming of live casts, but I wanted more. I wanted to be able to join into Mumble while preparing meals, I wanted to be able to load any website I wanted without lockups, and I wanted to stream video content and watch DVDs.




I was concerned that putting a laptop on the table was an invitation to have any spilled beverage sucked right into the air intakes, and I never even considered a desktop system in the dining room until I saw a refurbished Dell Inspiron 745 on GearXS.com (I wouldn't normally plug a specific vendor, but now GearXS is putting Ubuntu on all it's used corporate castoff systems). This Dell had the form factor that is ubiquitous in point-of-sale, a vertical skeleton frame with a micro system case on one side and a 17” LCD on the other, placing all the electronics several inches above the surface on which it is placed. I even found a turntable intended for small TVs that lets me smoothly rotate the monitor to either at my place on the table or back towards the kitchen where I am cooking. I already had a sealed membrane keyboard with an integrated pointer and wireless-N USB dongle to complete the package. Shipped, my “new” dual core 2.8Ghz Pentium D system with 80Gb hard drive and Intel graphics was under $150. [The turntable was $20 and an upgrade from 1Gb to 4Gb of used DDR2 was $30, but both were worth it.] Since the box shipped with Ubuntu, I thought installing the distro of my choice would be of no consequence, and that is where my tale begins.




I'm going to start my story towards the end, as it is the most important part. After the installation of four Linux distros in as many days (counting the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS the box shipped with, a partial installation of SolusOS 2r5, Fuduntu and finally Lubuntu 12.04), I discovered I couldn't boot due to Grub corruption (machine POSTed, but where I should have seen Grub, I got a blank screen with a cursor in the upper left corner). 




A. I thought I would do a total disk wipe and start over, but DBAN from the UBCD for Windows said it wasn't able to write to the drive (never seen that before) 

B. Started downloading the latest RescaTux ISO. Meanwhile, I found an article that told me I could repair Grub with a Ubuntu CD https://ubuntunigeria.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/how-to-restore-grub2-using-an-ubuntu-live-cd-or-thumb-drive/ , so I tried booting from the Lubuntu 12.04 CD (using the boot device selector built into the hardware). Same black screen, preceded by a message that the boot device I had selected was not present. Same thing with the Fuduntu DVD that had worked the day before. With the exception of UBCD, I couldn't get a live CD to boot. 

C. Now having downloaded the RescaTux ISO, and suspecting a problem with the optical drive, I used Unetbootin to make a RescaTux bootable thumb drive. RescaTux 

( http://download2.berlios.de/rescatux/rescatux_cdrom_usb_hybrid_i386_486-amd64_0.30b7_sg2d.iso ) has a pre-boot menu that let's you choose between 32 and 64 bit images, but that was as far as I got, nothing happened when I made my selection. 

D. At this point, I am suspecting a hardware failure that just happened to coincide with my last install. This is a Ultra Small Form Factor Dell, the kind you see as point of sale or hospital systems, so there weren't many components I could swap out. I didn't have any DDR2 laying around, but I did test each of the two sticks the system came with separately with the same results. I then reasoned a Grub error should go away if disabled the hard drive, so I physically disconnected the drive and disabled the SATA connector in the BIOS. I still couldn't boot to a live CD. Deciding there was a reason his machine was on the secondary market, I hooked everything back up and reset the BIOS settings to the defaults, still no luck. 

E. As a Hail Mary the next day, I burned the RescaTux ISO to a CD and hooked up and external USB optical drive. This time, I booted to the Live CD, did the two step grub repair, and when I unplugged the external drive, I was able to boot right into my Lubuntu install. Now booting to Live CDs from the original optical drive and from the thumb drive worked. RescaTux FTW. 




Now a little bit on how I got in this mess. As I said, the Dell shipped with 10.04, but I wanted something less pedestrian than Ubuntu (ironic I wound up there anyway). I tried Hybride, but once again, like my trial on the P4 I mentioned on LinuxBasix, the Live CD booted, but the icons never appeared on the desktop (I think it's a memory thing, the Dell only shipped with a gig, shared with the integrated video). After Hybride, I really wanted to be one of the cool kids and run SolusOS, but the install hung twice transferring boot/initrd.img-3.3.6-solusos. I casted around for a 64bit ISO I had on hand, and remembered I'd really wanted to give Fuduntu a try. Fuduntu is a rolling release fork of Fedora, with a Gnome 2 desktop, except that the bottom bar is replaced with a Mac style dock, replete with bouncy icons (cute at first,but I could tell right away they would get on my nerves). However, I found I liked the distro, despite the fact I found the default software choices a little light for a 900Mb download (Google Office, Chromium, no Firefox, no Gimp). Worst of all, no Mumble in the repos at all (really Fuduntu guys? While trying to install Mumble, do you know how many reviews I found that can be summed up as "Fuduntu is great, but why is there no Mumble?"). Unfortunately, I put Mumble on the back burner while I installed and configured my default set of comfort apps from the repos (Firefox, XChat, Gimp, VLC, LibreOffice, etc). [BTW, with the anticipated arrival of a 2.4ghz headset, I hope to be able to use the new machine to join the LUG/podcast while preparing and dare I say eating dinner.] 




I visited the Mumble installation page on SourceForge, and found they no longer linked to .deb files and fedora .rpms, as they assume you can install from your repositories. Thinking someone must have found an easy solution, I hit Google. The best answer I found was a page on the Fuduntu forums (http://www.fuduntu.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2237 ), that suggested downloading the Mumble and a dozen prerequisite library .rpm's from a third party site called rpm.pbone.net. I visited pbone.net, and found when I looked up each library, I got a dozen different links to versions of the file. Then I saw a link that seemed to offer the promise of simplifying my task, if I subscribed to pbone.net, I could add their whole catalog as a repo. While researching the legitimacy of pbone.net, I found them mentioned in the same sentence as RPMFusion as an alternate repository for Fedora. I decided to install the RPMFusion repos as well, thinking I might find some of the needed libraries in there. I registered with pbone, and discovered I would only have access to their repository for 14 days free, after which it would cost $3 a month (after all, hosting such a service must cost money). I figured the free trial would at least get Mumble installed, and went through the set up. Among the questions I had to answer were which Fedora version I was running (I picked 17, since Fuduntu is rolling) and 32 or 64 bit. pbone.net generated a custom .repo file to place in my /etc/yum.repos.d directory. At this time, I'd already set up RPMFusion. 




The fun started when I ran 'yum update'. I got "Error: Cannot find a valid baseurl for repo: rpmfusion-free". It turns out ( http://optics.csufresno.edu/~kriehn/fedora/fedora_files/f10/howto/repositories.html ) the location of the RPMFusion servers are usually commented out in the .repo files, Fedora must know where they are, but I guess Fuduntu does not. I uncommented each of the baseurl statements (there are three) in each of the RPMFusion .repo files (there are four files, free, non-free, free-testing, and non-free testing). I then re-ran 'yum update', this time I was told the paths for the RPMFusion baseurl's didn't exist. I opened up the path in a browser and confirmed it was indeed wrong. I pruned sub directories from the path one by one until I found a truncated url that actually existed on the RPMFusion FTP server. I looked at the .repo files again and figured out the paths referenced included global environment variables the were inconstant between Fedora and Fuduntu. For instance, $release in Fedora would return a value like 15, 16, or 17, where in Fuduntu it resolves to 2012. I figured if I took the time, I could walk up and down the FTP server and come up with literal paths to put in the RPMFusion .repo files, but instead I just moved the involved .repo files into another folder to be dealt with another day. 




I again launched 'yum update'. This time had no errors, but I was getting an excessive amount of new files from my new pbone.net repo ('yum update' updates your sources and downloads changed files all in one operation). It's possible the rolling Fuduntu is closer Fedora 16, so when I told pbone.net I was running 17, all the files in the alternate repo were newer than what i had. In any case, I had no wish to be dependent of a repo I had to rent at $3 a month, so I canceled the operation, admitted defeat, and started downloading the 64bit version of Lubuntu. I know I said I would rather have a more challenging distro, but because of it's location, this needs to be a just works PC, not a hack on it for half a day box. I would have like to have given Mageia, Rosa, or PCLinuxOS a shot, but too many packages from outside the repos (case in point, Hulu Desktop) are only available in Debian and Fedora flavors. You know the rest, I installed Lubuntu, borked my Grub, loop back to the top of the page.

Thoughtkindness: In Defense of Media Freetardation - Epicanis | 2012-10-24


It took 14 months longer than intended to get this episode done! To make up for it, I've unintentionally ended up with enough time of me talking to almost make up a minimal-useful-sized episode every month while everyone's been waiting.

Today's episode of "Thoughtkindness" consists of:
•Me begging for forgiveness for disappearing for a year.
•An update on "bunnies", my linux laptop from Ohava Computers
•Over an hour of my attempt to collect and explain why we need to make media on the internet more "freetarded"


After revealing what ticked me off and made me start on this episode, I launch into a short technical and historical talk about the handful of audio and video files that matter on the web today.

(Opus, Ogg Vorbis, WebM, MP3, Flash Video, MP4, and a few others).

Following this, I explain why I think the legally-free media formats are so important, and much more useful than most people seem to recognize, why I think we need to be paying more attention to audio than video, and what needs to happen to make legally-free media ubiquitous.

I conclude by once again begging for attention and foolishly publically announcing that I want to try to develop some software and invite everyone to pester me for it as well as for future audio shows. Maybe I won't be allowed to procrastinate for another year before producing more this time.

Let me know if this is helpful or at least entertaining...

Note: an Opus version of this episode will be available at http://hpr.dogphilosophy.net for either online listening in Firefox 15 or later, or downloading for listening in VLC or other Opus-supporting applications.

Recovery of an (en)crypted home directory in a buntu based system - FiftyOneFifty | 2012-10-22


Recovery of an (en)crypted home directory in a 'buntu based system 

by 5150




This is going to be the archetypal “How I Did It” episode because if fulfills the criterion of dealing with an issue most listeners will most likely never have to resolve, but might be invaluable to those few who some day encounter the same problem, how to recover an encrypted home folder on an Ubuntu system.

I enabled home folder encryption on installation of a Linux Mint 8 system some years back and it never gave me trouble until the day that it did. Suddenly, my login would be accepted, but then I would come right back to GDM. Finally I dropped into a text console to try to recover the contents of my home folder, and instead found two files, Access-Your-Private-Data.desktop and README.txt . README.txt explained that I had arrived in my current predicament because my user login and password for some reason were no longer decrypting my home folder (Ubuntu home folder encryption is tied to your login, no additional password is required). Honestly, until I lost access to my files, I 'd forgotten that I'd opted for encryption. I found two articles that described similar methods of recovery. I'd tried that following their instructions and failed, probably because I was mixing and matching what seemed to be the easiest steps to implement from the two articles. When I took another look at the material weeks later, I discovered I missed a link in the comments that led me to an improved method added at Ubuntu 11.04 that saves several steps: http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2011/04/introducing-ecryptfs-recover-private.html
1.
Boot to an Ubuntu distribution CD (11.04 or later)

2.
Create a mount point and mount the hard drive. Of course, if you configured you drive(s) with multiple data partitions (root, /home, etc) you would have to mount each separately to recover all the contents of your drive, but you only have to worry about decrypting your home directory. If you use LVM, and your home directory spans several physical drives or logical partitions, I suspect things could get interesting.
1.
$sudo mkdir /media/myhd
1.
/media is owned by root, so modifying it requires elevation


2.
You need to confirm how your hardrive is registered with the OS. I just ran Disk Utility and confirmed that my hard drive was parked at /dev/sda, that meant that my single data partition would be at /dev/sda1

3.
$sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/myhd

4.
Do a list on /media/myhd to confirm the drive is mounted
1.
$ls /media/myhd


5.
The new recovery command eliminates the need to re-create your old user
1.
$sudo ecryptfs-recover-private (yes, ecrypt not encrypt)

2.
You will have to wait a few minutes while the OS searches your hard drive for encrypted folders
1.
When a folder is found, you will see 

INFO: Found [/media/myhd/home/.ecryptfs/username/.Private].

Try to recover this directory? [Y/n]
◾
Respond “Y”


2.
You will be prompted for you old password

3.
You should see a message saying your data was mounted read only at 

/tmp/ecryptfs.{SomeStringOfCharacters}
◾
I missed the mount point at first, I was look for my files in /media/myhd/home/myusername




6.
If you try to list the files in /tmp/ecryptfs.{SomeStringOfCharacters}, you will get a “Permission Denied” error. This because your old user owns these files, not your distribution CD login
1.
[You will probably want to copy “/tmp/ecryptfs.{SomeStringOfCharacters}” into your terminal buffer as you will need to reference it in commands. You can select if with your mouse in the “Success” message and copy it with <Ctrl><Alt>c, paste it later with <Ctrl><Alt>v

2.
I tried to take ownership of /tmp/ecryptfs.{SomeStringOfCharacters}, I should have thought that would have worked.
1.
From my command prompt, I can see my user name is “ubuntu”

2.
$ sudo chown -R ubuntu /tmp/ecryptfs.{SomeStringOfCharacters}
◾
-R takes ownership of subdirectories recursively

◾
It's a good time to get a cup of coffee




7.
Next, we need to copy the files in our home directory to another location, I used an external USB drive (it was automounted under /media when I plugged it in). If you had space on the original hard drive, I suppose you could create a new user and copy the files to the new home folder. I decided to take the opportunity to upgrade my distro. Some of the recovered files will wind up on my server and some on my newer laptop.
1.
One could run Ubuntu's default file manager as root by issuing “sudo nautilus &” from the command line (the “&” sends the process to the background so you can get your terminal prompt back)
1.
Before copying, be sure to enable “View Hidden Files” so the configuration files and directories in you home directory will be recovered as well. As I said, there are select configuration files and scripts in /etc I will want to grab as well.


2.
I had trouble with Nautilus stopping on a file it couldn't copy, so I used cp from the terminal so the process wouldn't stop every time it needed additional input.
1.
$ cp -Rv /tmp/ecryptfs.{SomeStringOfCharacters} /media/USBDrive/Recovered
◾
Of course the destination will depend on what you've named your USB drive and what folder (if any) you created to hold your recovered files

◾
-Rv copies subdirectories recursively and verbosely, otherwise the drive activity light may be your only indication of progress. The cp command automatically copies hidden files as well.

◾
Because of the file ownership difficulties, I could only copy the decrypted home folder in its entirety, 



3.
 I still had trouble with access do to to ownership once I detached the external drive and remounted it on my Fedora laptop, but I took care of that with:
1.
$ su -c 'chown -R mylogin/media/USBDrive/Recovered'

Linux, Beer, and Who Cares? - FiftyOneFifty | 2012-10-11


By BuyerBrown, RedDwarf, and FiftyOneFifty

This is a recording of an impromptu bull session that came about one night after BuyerBrown, RedDwarf, and I had been waiting around on Mumble for another host to join in. After giving up on recording our scheduled podcast, we stayed up for about an hour talking and drinking when Buyer suddenly asked Red and I to find current events articles concerning Linux. When that task was completed, Buyer announced he was launching a live audiocast over Mixlr.com with us as his guests. You are about to hear the result. Topics range from the prospects of Linux taking over the small business server market, now that Microsoft has retreated from the field, Android tablets and the future of the desktop in general, and the (at the time) revelation that Steam would be coming to Linux (on the last point, let me be the first to say that I am glad some of the concerns in my rant appear to be unfounded, apparently after a lot of work, Left for Dead 2 runs faster under Linux than it does under Windows with equivalent hardware. This podcast was recorded on a whim but I can't promise it won't happen again.

Useful Vim Plugins - Dave Morriss | 2012-10-07


Useful Vim Plugins

I started learning vi a long time ago when I first encountered Unix systems. In those days you could usually count on a system having vi (or at a pinch, when the system would only boot into single user mode, ed). Learning Emacs didn't seem like a good choice since it wasn't usually available on the systems I was administering.

I don't remember when I changed to Vim, but for many years I have used it (actually gVim) as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), particularly for writing Bash and Perl scripts.

In these notes I have listed some of the plugins I use to enhance Vim and gVim's functionality. If you have never made enhancements to this editor, here's a site with a very good tutorial on how to install plugins http://www.installationwiki.com/Installing_Vim_Scripts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NERDTree
•Author: Marty Grenfell
•Version: 4.2.0
•Updated: 2011-12-28
•URL: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658

This plugin provides a file browser within Vim/gVim. A particular directory is opened by typing :NERDTree somedir. A tree is displayed in a window which can be scrolled and traversed to find files to edit.



In case you're interested, the colour theme I use in gVim is "Murphy".

Type :h NERD_tree for the large and comprehensive help file.

I prefer to use NERDTree in gVim and not in Vim. To achieve this I have the following in my ~/.vimrc
  " NERDTree settings (only in GUI mode)
  if has("gui_running")
      let NERDTreeRoot = '~'
      let NERDTreeIgnore = ['\~$', '\.swp$']
      let NERDTreeShowHidden = 1
      let NERDTreeShowBookmarks = 1
      let NERDTreeChDirMode = 2
  else
      let loaded_nerd_tree = 1
  endif


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bash-support
•Author: Fritz Mehner
•Version: 3.10
•Updated: 2012-06-01
•URL: http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=365

This one provides a Bash scripting IDE for Vim and gVim. I find it most usable in gVim where it offers a comprehensive set of menus which you can see in the example.

From the Help text:
  It is written to considerably speed up writing code in a consistent style.
  This is done by inserting complete statements, comments, idioms, and code
  snippets. Syntax checking, running a script, starting a debugger can be done
  with a keystroke. There are many additional hints and options which can
  improve speed and comfort when writing shell scripts.




The plugin can be used from the menu or by typing short-cut sequences such as \ct which inserts the current date and time at the cursor position. It's an amazingly detailed package that's well worth dedicating the time to learn if you often write Bash scripts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perl-support
•Author: Fritz Mehner
•Version: 5.1
•Updated: 2012-06-01
•URL: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=556

This plugin provides a Perl scripting IDE for Vim and gVim. As with the Bash plugin from the same author I find it most useful from gVim where the menus can be used to perform a wide range of actions.

Again, you can use it to insert statements, boilerplate text and comments, in a similar way to the Bash plugin. You can also get regular expression help, check, run and debug the script

Two of the functions I find particularly useful are perltidy and perlcritic. Perltidy will reformat your Perl script, and Perlcritic will critique it according to the rules based on Damian Conway's book Perl Best Practices.



Note the lower window showing the various problems detected by perlcritic.

If you are a C or C++ programmer Fritz Mehner also provides a plugin for these languages here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

manpageview
•Author: Charles E. Campbell, Jr.
•Version: v24
•Updated: 2011-01-03
•URL: http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#MANPAGEVIEW

This is a man page viewer for use within Vim. Use :Man topic or press K on a keyword. Can view perl, php and python help.

This is a great way to view man pages, with the ability to search and cut and paste the contents.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Surround
•Author: Tim Pope
•Version: 1.90
•Updated: 2010-03-06
•URL: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1697

The plugin provides mappings to easily delete, change and add "surroundings" such as quotes, braces and parentheses.

The following extract from the Help text should make this clearer:
  Consider the following examples.  An asterisk (*) is used to denote the cursor
  position.
  
    Old text                  Command     New text
    "Hello *world!"           ds"         Hello world!
    [123+4*56]/2              cs])        (123+456)/2
    "Look ma, I'm *HTML!"     cs"<q>      <q>Look ma, I'm HTML!</q>
    if *x>3 {                 ysW(        if ( x>3 ) {
    my $str = *whee!;         vlllls'     my $str = 'whee!';


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fugitive
•Author: Tim Pope
•Version: 1.2
•Updated: 2011-04-29
•URL: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2975

A very powerful interface to git.



The image shows the result of the :Gstatus command which is equivalent to typing git status on the command line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taglist
•Author: Yegappan Lakshmanan
•Version: 4.5
•Updated: 2007-09-21
•URL: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273

This plugin provides source code browsing by listing tags (functions, classes, structures, variables, etc.). The list is in a window in Vim or in a menu in gVim.

The plugin makes us of the Exuberant Ctags utility to index tags in a source file. I believe that most Linux distributions ship with this utility, but if not it seems to be easily available in repositories.



The image shows gVim with the tag list in a window. I find the menu in gVim more useful myself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supertab
•Author: Eric Van Dewoestine
•Version: 2.0
•Updated: 2012-06-01
•URL: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643

Provides insert completion functionality using the Tab key.



The example shows a Perl script where the choice being made from the list offered by Supertab is uptodate. Note also that manpageview is being used to view the manpage for the CPAN module.

It has taken me a while to learn not to use the Tab key to enter TAB characters but to use CTRL-Tab instead. However, I have decided that the advantages of redefining the Tab key in this way outweigh the disadvantages. You might not agree!

Preparing Pictures for Posting with the GIMP - Frank Bell | 2012-09-24


Frank Bell describes the process he uses to prepare photographs for posting pictures on his website. The goal of the process is not to transform the pictures, but to enhance them, and includes sharpening, adjusting the contrast and brightness, cropping, and resizing. Frank walks through applying the process to a snapshot from his deck garden.

A podcast about software patents/unitary patent - Frederic Couchet | 2012-09-18

In today's show we hear from the executive director of April, the main French association devoted to promoting and protecting Free Software.

 In the next few days, the legal affairs (JURI) Committee of the European Parliament will discuss on the next actions regarding the project for a unitary patent. Behind what looks like a technical text lies a crucial issue: who decides on what is patentable and what is not.

 As software patents are coming back in international news with the Apple/Samsung case, we need to ensure that such aberrations cannot happen in Europe. We calls for a general mobilisation to contact all MEPs, so that the European Parliament finally tackles the issue of the software patentability.

 April has put into place a few campaigning tools to inform and to raise MEPs' awareness. Everything is available on :

PXE Boot - Ken Fallon | 2012-07-19


In todays show, Ken tells of his struggle to get silent PC to work with his spare 17" monitor. His attempts to get a "VIA EPIA M9000 Mini ITX Motherboard" failed miserably and so he has turned to a HP Compaq t5000 thin client. As can be seen in this post here and discussed here. 

 

The OS installs fine from USB but you run into grub issues on reboot that require you to boot from USB disk to rectify and that runs into problems as the boot order get's confusing. To get around this I decided to install Debian via PXE boot or more commonly "Pixie" boot. A full description can be found on the debian wiki. Basically it involves setting up a DHCP server, a TFTP server and downloading a boot image. 

Once you have everything configured is a standard Debian net install. The only gotya is entering the MAC address of your Client and making sure you know what is happening on your network with regard to DHCP. I set the internal sd drive as the boot partition, created a 500Mb swap on my 4G external disk and put the root as the rest. I set both the boot and the root partition to ext2 as I didn't want the added strain of journaling on the sd media. 

I ran into the Grub 2 ERROR 17 issue which meant that I had to do some reading on Grub2 and we're back to the bad old days of lilo where you need run commands or your config changes are ignored. Anyway another Pixie boot, this time into recovery mode long enough to type update-grub. A quick reboot and we're into a standard Debian base install. 

I took the steps to installing Debian multimedia by adding the magic deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org squeeze main non-free to my /etc/apt/sources.list and then doing 
aptitude install debian-multimedia-keyring

to get the keyring in order. After that it was a aptitude update and a aptitude safe-upgrade and that was it. I was free to install anything I wanted.

Jonathan Kulp and NYbill: Goodwill Hunting - Various Hosts | 2012-07-11


Jonathan Kulp and NYbill talk about a little known resource for inexpensive tech finds. Thanks go to Windigo for the inspiration and episodes title from this dent: 

Jon's export business 

 The guys talk about Jon's finds at the Goodwill and his uses of the rigs. As is becoming somewhat of a theme, there is a digression into computer nostalgia and Linux origins. But, the guys get the episode back on track.

Migrating away from Google Reader - Ken Fallon | 2012-07-10


One of the major advantages of Google Reader over application based clients is that no matter where you access it from your views are synchronized. Everything you read is marked a read everywhere and you don't have to worry about whither you check your feeds on a desktop PC or on your phone. It truly is the best example of a cloud application out there. 

Except for the fact that I'm not happy with the idea of a complete stranger watching and recording every article I read, how long I read it for, and share that information around to other trusted partners. Remember when your parents/guardians caught you reading over their shoulder ? It wasn't acceptable then and it sure isn't now. Epically when I noticed that my search results changed dramatically after I started following certain feeds. It's just not right and here's why http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html 

        

Getting a list of my feeds

Google should be credited with the fact that they make exporting very easy to do. Thanks to the work of the http://www.dataliberation.org/ team. Who's stated goal is "Users should be able to control the data they store in any of Google's products. Our team's goal is to make it easier to move data in and out."
 For Google Reader this amounts to: 
Settings -> Reader Settings -> Import/Export -> OPML


OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) is an XML format for outlines (defined as "a tree, where each node contains a set of named attributes with string values"). Originally developed by Radio UserLand as a native file format for an outliner application, it has since been adopted for other uses, the most common being to exchange lists of web feeds between web feed aggregators.
 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML 

That's it. You now have a list of all your feeds we are still faced with the problem of reading/deleting items in one place and having them synchronized everywhere else ? The answer is actually quite obvious. 

imap - Internet Message Access Protocol
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol
 Internet message access protocol (IMAP) is one of the two most prevalent Internet standard protocols for e-mail retrieval, the other being the Post Office Protocol (POP). Virtually all modern e-mail clients and mail servers support both protocols as a means of transferring e-mail messages from a server. 

The great news is that there are imap clients everywhere. Microsoft Outlook supports it. Thunderbird, Evolution, Kmail, Claws-Mail all support it. It's supported on Android, the iPhone, and on Windows Mobile. There are a multitude of web clients. The only problem now was to find a way to get the RSS feeds over to a imap message format. A quick duckduckgo search later lead me to .... 

Feed2Imap

http://home.gna.org/feed2imap/
Feed2Imap is an RSS/Atom feed aggregator. After Downloading feeds (over HTTP or HTTPS), it uploads them to a specified folder of an IMAP mail server or copies them to a local maildir. The user can then access the feeds using Mutt, Evolution, Mozilla Thunderbird or even a webmail. 

It's in all the major repositories and I had it up and running in under ten minutes. It keeps it's settings in a hidden file .feed2imaprc in your home directory. The configuration is simple, four lines per feed. 
feeds:
 - name: kenfallon.com
   url: http://kenfallon.com/?feed=rss2
   target: imap://RSSNewsAccount%40example.com:PasswordForRSSNewsAccount@imap.example.com/INBOX.Feeds.Tech_Blogs
   include-images: true
...


The name filed is what will be the feed name and url is the link to the rss feed. The target is the path on the imap account you want to put it to. I used a throw away email account on my own domain with some restrictions on the size so that if I forget to check it won't affect the rest of my mailboxes. 
 The line it's broken into several parts, first is imap:// followed by the imap account user name and password. If your login contains an @ character, replace it with %40. Next is the @ sign followed by your server hostname and then the path. I chose INBOX.Feeds and then a subfolder for every group I had in Google Reader. The only other option I set was to include the images. 

opml2feed

I have quite a few feeds now and I did not want to be typing them in by hand. So I wrote a small perl script to convert the opml file into a .feed2imaprc format and it will hopefully get you most of the way. The code is available on https://gitorious.org/opml2feed ( thanks to Klaatu over at http://www.gnuworldorder.info/ where he covered using Git in the March 31, 2012: Episode 7x13.) 

Now setup the imap account on your mail client(s) and once you are happy run feed2imap and you should see the items beginning to appear. I set it to run every two hours at 14 minutes past the hour by adding the following line to my cron tab. 
14 */2 * * * /usr/bin/feed2imap >/dev/null 2>&1

About Rivendell with Rivendell

In this episode I talk about the Rivendell Radio Automation software whilst using the same software to play music and sound. This show was recorded "as live" and unscripted. I need a bit more practise as I'd like to use a similar setup to do my own podcast show. Did a bit of normalising and amplifing as the levels weren't that great (another thing to practise)

Stuff I forgot to mention: Talking about multiple tracks in Carts, you can set each track to only play under certain conditions, such as time or day of the week. RDPanel is an appilcation which is a large version of the sound panel in RDAirplay, great to have on a second monitor. Logs are playlists which can be saved and loaded an can be generated just by playing music in Airplay or building them manually in RDLogedit or automatically with RDLogManager. Rivendell can manage more than one radio station if needed and share the same DB.

Nix: The Functional Package Manager - goibhniu | 2012-06-24


An introduction to the Nix package manager and related projects: 

Nix is a purely functional package manager. This means that it can ensure that an upgrade to one package cannot break others, that you can always roll back to previous version, that multiple versions of a package can coexist on the same system, and much more.
 Nixpkgs is a large collection of packages that can be installed with the Nix package manager.
 NixOS is a Nix-based Linux distribution. Thanks to Nix, it supports atomic upgrades, rollbacks and multi-user package management, and it has a declarative approach to system configuration management that makes it easy to reproduce a configuration on another machine.
 Hydra is a Nix-based continuous build system.
 Disnix is a Nix-based distributed service deployment system.

Fix the "Sticky Keys" Bug in Minecraft - Windigo | 2012-06-12


A quickie episode by Windigo that covers a fix for the "Sticky Keys" bug in Minecraft on Linux. 

The "Sticky Keys" bug causes the Minecraft client to act as if a button hasn't been released when it has - which causes your character, Steve, to suffer some awful consequences as a result (depending on what situation you are in when the bug occurs). 

Upgrading the LWJGL libraries/drivers that come with Minecraft usually fixes this bug. To upgrade the drivers, do the following: 
• Download an updated version of the LWJGL libraries ◦LWJGL 2.8.0 - Not the latest release, but worked great for me 

• Copy the following files from lwjgl-2.8.0/jar/ in the zip file you downloaded to /home/[youruser]/.minecraft/bin/, replacing the existing files there: ◦jinput.jar
◦lwjgl.jar
◦lwjgl_util.jar

• Copy all of the files from lwjgl-2.8.0/natives/ in the zip file you downloaded to /home/[youruser]/.minecraft/bin/natives/, again replacing the existing files there 

If you still encounter issues with the new versions of the libraries, try a newer or older version until you find one that works with your system. 2.8.0 happens to work for my setup (Debian Stable w. Sun Java), but YMMV - your Minecraft may vary.

Poorly Recorded Thoughts On Rural Computing - lostnbronx | 2012-05-28

 Sorry for the sound quality. I recorded this in the car, Dave Yates style, with my Sanza Fuze v2, running Rockbox -- but my car is loud, and I had the Fuze hanging precariously from my jacket, where it was covered over half the time.

Do the four freedoms extend beyond software ? - Ken Fallon | 2012-05-24


On Linux For The Rest Of Us #74 - The Legistrative Session, one of our correspondents Mr. Gadgets, called in the following question. The segment begins at at 01:00:30 and in it he describes a conversation about the four freedoms where someone who's opinion he respected stated "the four freedoms only cover programming. It is only the code that is covered in the four freedoms". 

For those of you who don't know The Free Software Definition boils down to the following rules: 
•Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
•Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
•Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
•Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.


If you read the The Free Software Definition, then yes all the references are to "software" only....
 ...that is of course until you get to the section Beyond Software, in the same document, which states: 


 Software manuals must be free, for the same reasons that software must be free, and because the manuals are in effect part of the software. 
 The same arguments also make sense for other kinds of works of practical use - that is to say, works that embody useful knowledge, such as educational works and reference works. Wikipedia is the best-known example. 
 Any kind of work can be free, and the definition of free software has been extended to a definition of free cultural works applicable to any kind of works.  

So in summary, as HPR is now released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported lisence, any shows that provide useful knowledge, such as educational works and reference works are covered by the four freedoms.

Making a Music Sampler with Midi and Pygame - bgryderclock | 2012-05-20


Pygame Midi documentation:
http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/midi.html 

Pygame Mailing List:
http://www.pygame.org/wiki/info 

Midi.py sample from pygame example folder: 
https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/src/25e3f2cee879/examples/midi.py 

Sampler/Sound Looper made from python, pygame and midi:
http://www.pygame.org/project-BadPenni+-+MIDI+Triggered+Sound+Looper-1734-.html 


Sample values that populate midi_events variable:


Middle C note key press (notice the data1 is 60 and data2 is 127)
 <Event(34-Unknown {'status': 144, 'vice_id': 2, 'timestamp': 6701, 'data1': 60, 'data3': 0, 'data2': 127})>


Middle C note key release (notice the data1 is 60 and data2 is 0)
 <Event(34-Unknown {'status': 128, 'vice_id': 2, 'timestamp': 6764, 'data1': 60, 'data3': 0, 'data2': 0})>


Middle C# note key press (notice the data1 is now 61)
 <Event(34-Unknown {'status': 144, 'vice_id': 2, 'timestamp': 206684, 'data1': 61, 'data3': 0, 'data2': 127})>


Python code snippet that pulls the note number from the midi_events list and appends an "off" string if it is a key release. 


if str(midi_events[0][0][2]) != "0":
 midinote = str(midi_events[0][0][1])
 else: 
 midinote = str(midi_events[0][0][1]) + "off"


Controlling sounds with if statements and our midinote variable:


distbassrollloop = pygame.mixer.Sound("7FullCircleDistBassRollLoop.wav")
 distsnarerollloop = pygame.mixer.Sound("7FullCircleDistSnareRollLoop.wav")
 distbass = pygame.mixer.Sound("7FullCircleDistBassPad.wav")
 distsnare = pygame.mixer.Sound("7FullCircleDistSnare.wav")


if midinote == "48":
 distbass.play()


if midinote == "49":
 distbassrollloop.play(1000)


if midinote == "49off":
 distbassrollloop.stop()


if midinote == "50":
 distsnare.play()


if midinote == "51":
 distsnarerollloop.play(1000)


if midinote == "51off":
 distsnarerollloop.stop()

Larry Cafiero - the Crunchbang guy

http://larrythecrunchbangguy.wordpress.com/category/lfnw/ 

Larry the CrunchBang Guy is Larry Cafiero, 54, who runs Redwood Digital Research in Felton, California, which provides Free/Open Source Software solutions for the small business/home office environment. He has been an advocate for Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) since the fall of 2006. Toward the end of 2006, he had an epiphany or satori regarding the social, philosophical, political and economic benefits of using FOSS on his favored hardware, which at the time consisted of the Mac PowerPC platform (although he has warmed up to Intel machines as of late). He organized a project to promote GNU/Linux which turned out to be the Lindependence events in Felton, California, in 2008. Larry’s brush with fleeting fame came in 2006 as the Green Party’s candidate for Insurance Commissioner in California (270,218 votes, 3.2 percent). He has been using CrunchBang on a regular basis since July 2011.

Broadband for Rural North - Ken Fallon | 2012-05-03


#da12bb #HPR
 In todays show Ken talks to Chris Conder of the Broadband for Rural North (http://b4rn.org.uk/).
A big line of people with spades 

Located in the very pretty but the rural Forest of Bowland in Lancashire in the UK, and tired of putting up with slow 'broadband' they decided to put together their own network. They tried shared wifi, 3 and 4G mobile networks, MMDS and Satellite yet all proved to be unreliable. 

So over tea and cake they came up with a plan. 
•A 240 Kilometer (150 mile) plan.
•A 1 gigabit (1000mb/sec) fiber optic connection plan.
•A let's give a connection to every one of the 1700 homes, farms, schools, churches and businesses, in the area plan
And while they were at it they designed it to be: •redundant with a dual homed backbone direct to the UK's Internet exchange
•upgradeable with ducts large enough to take multiple fibers
•laid through some of the most rugged, mountainous area of Lancashire to get to the people that need it most. (And let's be clear here, nothing to do with the fact that they will need to use dynamite to blast their way through the rocks.)


Chris herself has lived in the Lune Valley for many years and is married to a farmer in Wray. She has been involved with the community in many roles over the years; for instance school governor and chair of Wray Endowed school during the eighties and early nineties and more recently supporter of a number of rural broadband projects. In 2002 she began campaigning for rural broadband and over the next few years helped establish a wireless network around Wray and a satellite network for rural farms. A founder member of Wray Com Com in 2003 (http://www.wraycomcom.org.uk/) and Wennet CIC in 2005 (http://www.wennetcic.co.uk). She is a pioneer of self installation fibre and a regular speaker at broadband events on the topic of rural broadband and DIY fibre build. 
 She is also a 'online animator' for high speed broadband for Europe. She posts on the blog (http://daa.ec.europa.eu/group/2/content") and your feedback would be MORE than welcome. Europe assures her that they are listening. You can contact her at c.conder@b4rn.org.uk and be sure to tweet the hash tag #da12bb

FFMPEG for video Conversion - BrocktonBob | 2012-04-17

Hello Hacker Public Radio
 BrocktonBob here with my tutorial on how I use FFMPEG to convert video's to any format I like.
 FFMPEG is a terminal program used in linux,but windows and mac users can use WINFF which is the gui frontend for FFMPEG.
 FFMPEG is more powerful than WINFF because you have more controll when you use the terminal than a gui.Below are the examples I used in this podcast.
 I hope you give it a try

 My Examples:
ffmpeg -i glue.flv glue.avi
ffmpeg -i glue.flv glue.mp3
ffmpeg -i glue.flv -target ntsc-dvd output.mpg

Raspberry Pi spec review - Ken Fallon | 2012-04-16


Raspberry Pi Board IO OverviewIn todays show Klaas-Jan walks Ken throught the possibilities of the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It’s a capable little PC which can be used for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video. We want to see it being used by kids all over the world to learn programming. All for under $35.

Connectors

RCA connector
Composite video is the format of an analog television (picture only) signal before it is combined with a sound signal and modulated onto an RF carrier. In contrast to component video (YPbPr) it contains all required video information, including colors in a single line-level signal. Like component video, composite-video cables do not carry audio and are often paired with audio cables (see RCA connector). 

A photo of a HDMI connector
HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a compact audio/video interface for transmitting encrypted uncompressed digital data. HDMI implements the EIA/CEA-861 standards, which define video formats and waveforms, transport of compressed, uncompressed, and LPCM audio, auxiliary data, and implementations of the VESA EDID. HDMI supports, on a single cable, any uncompressed TV or PC video format, including standard, enhanced, high definition and 3D video signals; up to 8 channels of compressed or uncompressed digital audio; a Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) connection; and an Ethernet data connection. 

General Purpose Input/Output (a.k.a. GPIO) is a generic pin on a chip whose behavior (including whether it is an input or output pin) can be controlled (programmed) through software.
 GPIO pins have no special purpose defined, and go unused by default. The idea is that sometimes the system integrator building a full system that uses the chip might find useful to have a handful of additional digital control lines, and having these available from the chip can save the hassle of having to arrange additional circuitry to provide them. For example, the Realtek ALC260 chips (audio codec) have 4 GPIO pins, which go unused by default. Some system integrators (Acer laptops) employing the ALC260 use the first GPIO (GPIO0) to turn on the amplifier used for the laptop's internal speakers and external headphone jack. 

A Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter, abbreviated UART is a type of "asynchronous receiver/transmitter", a piece of computer hardware that translates data between parallel and serial forms. UARTs are commonly used in conjunction with communication standards such as EIA, RS-232, RS-422 or RS-485. The universal designation indicates that the data format and transmission speeds are configurable and that the actual electric signaling levels and methods (such as differential signaling etc.) typically are handled by a special driver circuit external to the UART.
 A UART is usually an individual (or part of an) integrated circuit used for serial communications over a computer or peripheral device serial port. UARTs are now commonly included in microcontrollers. A dual UART, or DUART, combines two UARTs into a single chip. Many modern ICs now come with a UART that can also communicate synchronously; these devices are called USARTs (universal synchronous/asynchronous receiver/transmitter). 

I²C ("i-squared cee"; Inter-Integrated Circuit; generically referred to as "two-wire interface") is a multi-master serial single-ended computer bus invented by Philips that is used to attach low-speed peripherals to a motherboard, embedded system, cellphone, or other electronic device. Since the mid 1990s, several competitors (e.g., Siemens AG (later Infineon Technologies AG), NEC, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics (formerly SGS-Thomson), Motorola (later Freescale), Intersil, etc.) brought I²C products on the market, which are fully compatible with the NXP (formerly Philips's semiconductor division) I²C-system. As of October 10, 2006, no licensing fees are required to implement the I²C protocol. However, fees are still required to obtain I²C slave addresses allocated by NXP.
 SMBus, defined by Intel in 1995, is a subset of I²C that defines the protocols more strictly. One purpose of SMBus is to promote robustness and interoperability. Accordingly, modern I²C systems incorporate policies and rules from SMBus, sometimes supporting both I²C and SMBus with minimal re-configuration required. 

Serial Peripheral Interface Bus bus diagram
The Serial Peripheral Interface Bus or SPI (pronounced like "S.P.I." or "spy") bus is a synchronous serial data link standard named by Motorola that operates in full duplex mode. Devices communicate in master/slave mode where the master device initiates the data frame. Multiple slave devices are allowed with individual slave select (chip select) lines. Sometimes SPI is called a "four-wire" serial bus, contrasting with three-, two-, and one-wire serial buses.

Roku XD box - riddlebox | 2012-03-25


I recently bought a roku XD box and I want to do a little review for you guys. First I would like to say that we have basic cable, and werent really looking to become "cord cutters". You can check out the roku site at www.roku.com.

 

First I bought it from Best buy for 79.99 I think it was 84 dollars with tax. First I cant believe how tiny this thing is! When you open the box, you have the device, a remote and some RCA AV Cables. The XD also only works with wireless internet. The one I bought does have a HDMI port on it. It works great and does Netflix and other services like Amazon and Hulu Plus. 

You sign up for a roku account on the website and associate the roku box to that account. Which is close to what you do with most media type boxes now a days like blueray players and stuff. The only difference is those devices only give you content from a couple places. The roku actually has channels, that you can add to your roku box. I have added many channels on it and I am watching lots of content from the web. With services like Popcorn flix, which shows you movies and during those movies there are some commercials. They arent really that bad its like 1 commercial when they show it. It is always the same commercial though. Which kinda gets annoying. 

I use Netflix, and Crackle on it was well. There are lots of news channels like NBC also I know that MLB and I think NHL have channels too. I was amazed at the selection of channels on the device. It would be nice if the roku site had a listing of all private channels. As it is hard to search the internet to find a list, then add the code on the roku site only to find out that the channel code doesnt work anymore. There really are so many channels that you can add it is hard to explain them all. 

My wife and I both have android phones and we installed the roku remote control app which works great! As long as you are on the same wifi network as the roku you can control it. My wife is using the roku box for netflix and other services more than our blueray players because she likes the interface to netflix better. She says that just getting around the netflix channel is just so much easier! I even found a mythtv channel. All in all I am real happy with the Roku box and would recomend it to anyone to supplement their basic cable package. I think it really goes hand in hand with a basic cable or HD Antenna where you can get your network channels, but still get alot of the extra content for free or a reasonable price. 

I will say that I would like to try Hulu Plus and see if I can slowly ween myself from Cable or HD Antenna. I really doubt it because of the way the cable companies are in the US. Right now since I get my internet from the cable company(Charter) if I get basic Digital television with it then I actually get the two of them for a cheaper price than if I just got the cable internet from them. I would like to end by saying that I know I have only mentioned a few of the channels that roku offers but there really are so many of them and they are scattered in many places that it is tough to know about them all. So if you want you can email me james.middendorff@gmail.com I am on google+ as well. 

Thanks

Cloning Windows WiFi Profiles and Installing Skype Under 64-bit Fedora - FiftyOneFifty | 2012-03-06


The other day I was copying a customer's files and settings from a old laptop to a new one. Much of this tedious task was handled automatically by Fab's Autobackup (http://fpnet.fr/ , and 25% until Valentines Day BTW ), but I was disappointed that his dozen WiFi access point profiles and passwords were not one among the settings that Fab's copied for me. For a family laptop, you usually just have to re-enter the password for just the home router, and maybe once again for your work wireless. If your are a tech for an enterprise, and the new mobile workstation needs to connect to multiple access points, you always wind up walking around the business or campus, connecting to each in SSID in turn and entering a different key. This time, the laptop would be used in multiple remote offices. The user would have been able to re-create those connections as he traveled to each office, but he asked me if it wouldn't be possible instead to transfer the profiles with the rest of his data.



I had no doubt that I would be able to find a free tool to backup and restore wireless connections, but I have become wary of Windows utilities that can be found at the end of a Google search but have not been recommended by other techs or a trusted website. I was surprised to find my answer in some functions added to the DOS netsh, (or "net shell") command, starting with Windows Vista.



Open a Windows command prompt on the laptop that already has the WiFi keys set up, ergo the old one, and type:



netsh wlan show profiles



then press return. This will give you a list of your existing wireless connection profiles by name (i.e. by SSID). Now you can pick a WiFi profile name and enter on the command line:



netsh wlan export profile name="SSID_above_in_quotes" folder="C:\destination"



Quotes are required for the WiFi profile name, but not for the destination folder unless you use spaces in you Windows directory names. If you want to create export files for all your wireless connections, you may omit the "name=" part. 



netsh wlan export profile folder=



Omitting "file=" of course creates export files in the current directory.



The netsh wlan export profile command generates a .XML export file for each selected profile. Each export file contains an SSID, channel, encryption type and a hash of the encryption key to be transferred to the new laptop, except that it doesn't work, at least not for me and several others who posted articles to the web. On my first try, I was able to import everything but the encryption key, all the access points showed up in "Manage Wireless Networks", but I was prompted for a key when I tried to connect. I thought maybe this was Microsoft's attempt at security, but I could see a field for the hash in the .XML and when I went back to the article on netsh and it was clear I was supposed to get the keys too. A little more googlsearch revealed a second article on netsh that gave me an argument the first one omitted, adding key=clear at the very end of the netsh command causes the keys to be exported in clear text! Our command now looks like:



netsh wlan export profile folder= key=clear



Copy your .XML profile files to the new laptop (I am assuming via USB key). The filenames will be in the format:

Wireless Network connection-.xml



You understood me correctly, this DOS command generates file names with spaces in them. Copy the .XML files to the new system and import the profiles with:



netsh add profile filename=".xml" 



It's not quite as odious as it looks because DOS now supports TAB completion, so you just have to type:



netsh add profile filename="Wi and press 



The rest of the name of the first profile will be filled in, complete with the terminating quote. Press  and you should get a message that wireless profile has been imported. To import the remaining profiles, just use  or the up arrow and edit the last command. Since it was set to auto-connect, the laptop I was working on made a connection to the local access point the instant the corresponding profile was imported.



Learning these new netsh functions may make configuring WiFi more convenient (I can maintain a library of wireless profiles for the organizations I service, or I could implement an encryption key update via a batch file). I can also see ominous security implications for networks where users aren't supposed to be privy to the connection keys and have access to pre-configured laptops, such as schools. One could whitelist the MAC addresses of only the organization's equipment, but there is always that visiting dignitary to whom you are expected to provide unfettered network access. Besides, anyone with access to the command line can use ipconfig to display the laptop's trusted MAC address, which can be cloned for access from the parking lot or from across the street. The only way I see to secure the connection from someone with physical access to a connected laptop is to install kiosk software that disables the command line.



Installing Skype on 64-bit Fedora



Last week I decided to install Skype as an alternative way to contact people with land lines. I haven't played with Skype since I had it on my Windows workstation, so I downloaded and installed the .rpm for Fedora 13+. All Skype has is a 32-bit package for Fedora, and sure enough, when I tried to launch Skype, the icon bounced around Compize fashion, then the application item on the taskbar closed without doing anything. I looked for information in troubleshooting Skype from the logs, and an Arch wiki article told me I might have to create ~/.Skype/Logs , which I did. The application continued to crash without generating a log. I heard someone mention once in a call in podcast that they'd had to perform additional steps to make 32-bit Skype work in 64 bit Fedora 15, and a Google search took me to the khAttAm blog (link below). I experienced some trepidation because the steps involve installing additional 32 bit libraries (if you heard me on the Hacker Public Radio New Years Eve shows, you might have heard me say I've experienced a bit of dependency hell over conflicts between 32 and 64 bit libraries) but the instructions in the article went flawlessly (I don't know if khattam.info represents one person or more than one, but you rock!). http://www.khattam.info/howto-install-skype-in-fedora-15-64-bit-2011-06-01.html



First, as root run yum update  

Next, add the following line to /etc/rpm/macros (create it if it doesn't exist):


%_query_all_fmt %%{name}-%%{version}-%%{release}.%%{arch}





Finally, install these 32-bit libraries:


yum install qt.i686 qt-x11.i686 libXv.i686 libXScrnSaver.i686


After that, I was able to launch the application and log into my Skype account.

Heresies in the year of the apocalypse ep 1 - computer languages - MrGadgets | 2012-02-20


Mr Gadgets calls in Apocalyptic year 2012 where he discusses Assembler, COBOL and Grace Hopper

From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper

Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper (December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy officer. A pioneer in the field, she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, and developed the first compiler for a computer programming language. She conceptualized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first modern programming languages. She is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches (motivated by an actual moth removed from the computer). Because of the breadth of her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace." The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Hopper (DDG-70) was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.

Updating a Garmin GPS for free - riddlebox | 2012-02-13


Notice **I am not condoning this method I am just reporting that I have read on numerous sites the steps and procedures on how to do this.****
Sources: •http://www.haklabs.com/2011/garmin-2012-map-update/
•http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBlS0fzWjbY

 Updating a Garmin GPS for free

 This is a guide that I have compiled on how to upgrade a Garmin GPS to the 2012 maps for free. First you must torrent the "Garmin City Navigator 2012.10 torrent file, or the 2012.20 torrent file.

 2012.10 http://www.megaupload.com/?d=9DAC19AT

 2012.20 http://www.multiupload.com/L4AVMTU4WA

 Then you extract the contents of that into a folder and

1.Connect your device to the computer.
2.Go into the Nuvi files and backup the file named gmapprom.img to your computer.
3.Delete the gmapprom.img file from the device. (note: make sure you empty the recycle bin after this step)
4.Delete any unused Language files too..
5.Copy the unlocked gmapprom.img file that you downloaded into the device. If the downloaded file is named something else, rename it to gmapprom.img and then put it on your devices internal memory.
6.Restart your device and check your map info via : Tools>Settings>Map>Map Info.

 There you have it! You have done it.

Tag Team Chase Douglas Interview with Alison Chaiken - marcoz | 2012-02-12

Chase Douglas is a software developer at Canonical working primarily on multitouch user interface support. For the past year, Chase has been involved with developing gesture support through Canonical’s uTouch framework and multitouch support through the X.org window system. Prior to working on multitouch, Chase spent three years performing Linux kernel and plumbing layer development and maintenance at Canonical and IBM.

 Alison's questions: 3:49 - Alison asks "Chase, back up for a moment, can you talk a little bit about what X input is and how X in general works in Linux."

 6:13 - Alison asks "Do you have any particular target hardware that you are thinking about during its development?"

 11:57 - Alison asks "Do we expect the mouse and keyboard to be with us in the long term? Are you really thinking of all these touches used in concert with the mouse and keyboard or that we may be evolving away from that?"

 17:45 - Alison basically asks "Is there talk about an agreed upon gesture language?"

 20:56 - Alison asks "What is the state of device driver support for capacitive screens that will support multitouch in Linux?"

 26:34 - Alison asks "Speaking of software coupling, are you looking at Wayland already or is that still over the horizon?"

 28:43 - Alison says "The automotive case seems like a fascinating one. As far as touch and gesture goes and Ubuntu has an IDI and recently Cadillac has a multitouch screen that has haptic feedback and some gesture support. This looks like a very exciting area for development. Actual shipping products in 2012. I don't know if you're familiar with that at all."

 32:11 - Alison asks "Do you anticipate contributing the multitouch work to GNOME and Debian as well?

 35:0 - Alin asks "What new features can we anticipate that will be user visible for precision in the area of multitouch and gestures?"

 43:56 - Alison says "I think I'm happy although I must mention I was pained to hear that it was 24 years ago that you were an infant because I was at M.I.T when they started the X project. heh heh. you young whippersnappers. ... that was very fascinating. I had no idea there was that much activity going on. I'm really excited to see what's coming out and what new features are being added."

Elfstedentocht - To be or not to be - Ken Fallon | 2012-02-08


In today's show Ken interviews Klaas-Jan Koopman about the Elfstedentocht a particularly Dutch phenomenon. He gives us some background to the tour and tells the story of his Father who has a permit to participate should it go ahead.
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This interview was recorded yesterday and since then the organisation committee have said that the tour will not be going ahead this weekend as the ice is not thick enough. We can all wait and see together if it happens or not.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfstedentocht 
Elfstedentocht

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

The Elfstedentocht (or, in West Frisian, Alvestêdetocht, sometimes in English : Eleven Cities Tour), at almost 200 km, is the world's largest speed skating competition and leisure skating tour, and is held in the province of Friesland, Netherlands only when the ice along the entire course is 15 cm thick. 

The tour, almost 200 km in length, is conducted on frozen canals, rivers and lakes between the eleven historic Frisian cities: Leeuwarden, Sneek, IJlst, Sloten, Stavoren, Hindeloopen, Workum, Bolsward, Harlingen, Franeker, Dokkum then returning to Leeuwarden. The tour is not held every year, mostly because not every Dutch winter permits skating on natural ice. The last editions were in 1985, 1986 and 1997. Adding to that, the tour currently features about 15,000 amateur skaters taking part, putting high requirements on the quality of the ice. There is a stated regulatory requirement for the race to take place that the ice must be (and remain at) a minimum thickness of 15 centimetres along the entirety of the course. All skaters must be a member of the Association of the Eleven Frisian Cities. A starting permit is required. Further more, in each city the skater must collect a stamp, as well as a stamp from the three secret check points. The skater must finish before midnight.

Uber Leet Hacker Force Radio 6 - sigflup | 2012-02-06

In a welcome return to HPR, SigFIUP talks to us about two of her projects: 
concr

concr is an encryption framework for use to partially encrypt configuration files, or any file for that matter. concr is for use in UNIX systems and consist of two parts, libconcr and confcrypt. libconcr is an API for reading partially encrypted files and generating keys. confcrypt is a user-application for encrypting files using keyfile database or manually specified keys. 

concr leverages the own-by-root aspect of programs in UNIX systems and stores it's decryption key inside of the application. Applications that use libconcr must be installed with execute-only permissions. 

When an application is linked with and makes use of concr it, when run for the first time, will generate a copy of itself containing a private rsa-key and output a public rsa-key. confcrypt is a user program that encrypts messages to be decrypted by second runs of the application. concr provides an api similar to that of libc for reading in files thus making it transparent to the application developer what is and is not encrypted in those files. 

https://devio.us/~sigflup/concr 

yesplz

yesplz is a screeenshot uploader command line utility written by sigFLUP that will take a screenshot, tag your photo, log into unixporn.com, post the picture to your photo album, and return an ascii bunny on success. 

In order for it to work, you must have an account at unixporn.com but that is free and you can enter nothing but fake information into it. 

Then simply run yesplz --help to see the possible tags and instructions for yesplz.

Kernel Quote


"Here’s the different active kernel versions that I am maintaining at the moment:
 3.2.y – this will be maintained until 3.3 comes out
 3.1.y – there will be only one, maybe two, more releases of this tree
 3.0.y – this is the new "longterm" kernel release, it will be
 maintained for 2 years at the minimum by me.
 2.6.32.y – this is the previous "longterm" kernel release. It is
 approaching it’s end-of-life, and I think I only have
 another month or so doing releases of this. After I am
 finished with it, it might be picked up by someone else, but
 I’m not going to promise anything.
 All other longterm kernels are being maintained in various forms
 (usually quite sporadically, if at all), by other people, and I can not
 speak for their lifetime at all, that is up to those individuals."
– Greg Kroah-Hartman
 There was also a bit of a dust up between Tim Gardner of Canonical and Greg Kroah-Hartman over maintenance of the 2.6.32 kernel once greg gives it up. It appears to have been started by a misunderstanding and a conclusion jump by Tim.

Microsoft Now Collects Extortion On Approximatley 70% Of All US Sales Of Androids


LG is the latest victim to pay Microsoft’s extortion demands. They are the eleventh victim in this extortion scheme. A list of the other victims includes Samsung, HTC, and Acer. This leaves Motorola Mobility as the only major manufacturer to not sign an extortion agreement with Microsoft. I would wager that Microsoft has not even approached Motorola as Google now owns Motorola and those pockets are deep enough to scare off the Microsoft patent trolls. Microsoft now claims that they are collecting "royalties" on over 70% of all Android smart phones sold in the US. The terms of this latest agreement are unknown as Microsoft makes part of the agreement that the parties can not make public the patents covered by Microsoft’s claims. In other words a typical extortion agreement.


The MPAA Instigates A Dustup with Ars Technica
 On 1/10 the MPAA (Motion Picture Associtation of America) said on it’s blog, "… Ars Technica, a tech blog with a long history of challenging efforts to curb content theft,". This entire claim by the MPAA appears to be Ars Technica opposing things in the past like the broadcast flag which would have allowed remote control of peoples home entertainment recording devices, along with their stand against DRM that prevents owners from ripping legal backup copies of their DVDs. Ars also has publicly opposed the horrendous SOPA legislation currently in front of Congress. It is obvious that the MPAA’s position is the wacky correlation of fighting for consumers’ rights is the equivalent of having no enforcement at all.


Not that any representative of the MPAA would ever engage in outlandish statements to further their cause. Like this quote from Jack Valenti when he appeared before congress in 1982, "I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone."


United States Migrates Spy Drone Control Panels From Windows To Linux
 Last September the ground control systems for the Reaper drones, which reside at the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, became infected with a virus. When it happed the Air Force dismissed this intrusion as a nuisance that posed no real threat, it was however taken very seriously.


Still the discovery of this virus on the Air Force’s systems was a huge embarrassment. This is what they had to say at the time:


"The malware in question is a credential stealer, not a key logger, found routinely on computer networks and is considered more of a nuisance than an operational threat. It is not designed to transmit data or video, nor is it designed to corrupt data, files or programs on the infected computer. Our tools and processes detect this type of malware as soon as it appears on the system, preventing further reach.", they also went on to say, "The ground system is separate from the flight control system Air Force pilots use to fly the aircraft remotely; the ability of the pilots to safely fly these aircraft remained secure throughout the incident,"
 Screen shots of drone control computers posted by security researcher Mikko Hypponen show that some of the systems have been migrated from Microsoft Windows to Linux. In a statement Mikko Hypponen said,


"If I would need to select between Windows XP and a Linux based system while building a military system, I wouldn’t doubt a second which one I would take."
 Open Source Surgery, a Robot called Raven takes Flight


The Raven 2 is a surgical robot with 7 degrees of freedom, compact electronics and two wing-like arms which end in tiny gripper claws designed to perform surgery on simulated patients. The robot’s software is compatible with Robot Operating System, an open source robotics coding platform.

Introduction to Pagekite. - Kevin Granade | 2012-01-26


Welcome to my awkward second episode.
 Today I'll be introducing you to pagekite, a service for giving a public face to your local servers.
 Check it out at http://www.pagekite.net 



Bring your localhost servers on-line.

PageKite is software that gives your localhost servers names and makes them globally visible. It works with any computer and any Internet connection. It's so easy you'll never want to think about routers, IP addresses or other technicalities again. It's open source, too!

TV Downloader TED - riddlebox | 2012-01-24

Hello everyone its riddle box, sorry its been so long since I have done a podcast.
 Today I am going to tell you about my kinda sorta home dvr that I have at the moment. No, this isn't another show talking about mythtv....even though the mythtv project is a good one... our myth box at home died a while back and we lost three tuner cards which I hadn't realized how expensive the setup was getting to be needing all of the tuner cards and a back end server that could handle everything. So I looked at a debian server I have been using as my zoneminder server which just records two a cameras when there is motion. I found a Java app called TED - or torrent episode downloaded from www.Ted.nu. as the name states it uses torrents to download the shows. with this application which you download and launch from the jar file.. I had to use a --no-tray switch to get it to run. Once you open the jar file you are greeted with the app and a list of the popular shows. You can tell it to start torrenting those shows and you can tell Ted the frequency of how often to look for new shows. You can even tell it to he past shows. So Igot Ted all configured the way I wanted then I setup a guest samba share on my downloads folder so my blue ray player can see the share and now I just go to my blue ray player and see what shows are available to watch. Some shows may show up a couple days after they air but overall it works great.

Howdy folks, this is FiftyOneFifty. 
 What you are about to hear is the result of me starting a mixdown recording in Mumble when Pokey said he was about ready to stop recording and go to bed. While it's all pretty tame, it's not entirely safe for work. I started recording sometime after midnight Central Time and the original file shows we talked for another two hours and fifteen minutes (deleting the pauses brings it down to about an hour and a half). At the end it's just me and Cobra2, proving that as in real life, I never know when it's time to gracefully leave a party :) 
 Among the other voices you will hear are Pokey, Delwin, JNeuster, Deltaray, DoorToDoorGeek, and I thought it was especially cool when the world wrapped around and Ken Fallon came back in after having gone to bed the night before. I didn't have the forethought to make note of all the handles active in the room, and the festivities of the evening did not enhance my recall, so I apologize to those I have overlooked. With the help of the community, I hope to get you proberly credited in the show notes, even if it is after the fact. 

I regret I wasn't able to participate or listen too in the entire thirteen hour scheduled recording, since I am speaking to the future I am sure I will be enjoying those missed hours even as you hear this. I want to add my voice in gratitude and congratulations to those who organized and participated in making this event a success.

The discussion focused on how you can support free software and free culture with many paying more for "Free" software than they ever had for proprietary software. Many feel they pay what the can when they can. 

The discussion move on to how artists can make a living. 
 Should we draw the line between digital replication and physical replication as copyright infringement, although illegal, is not stealing. Not every download is a lost sale and the argument was made that in some cases "piracy" promotes the use of the software. There was much talk of the continual increase of the copyright terms. 

Time was then devoted to how artists could be compensated for their art and several examples were brought up of alternative means of generating revenue by cutting out the record labels and other middle men.

This segment started with a discussion on accessibility. We are looking for a way to convert the audio to text so that deaf/hard of hearing people can enjoy our content. That lead to a discussion on Text to speech and that if you are uncomfortable or unable to record a show for HPR, then there are loads of people who will narrate a scrip for you. 

The discussion turned to the question of how to pick topics for HPR and while the advice is to pick a topic that you're excited about you can always look at the Requested topics section of HPR at http://hackerpublicradio.org/contribute.php#requested_topics. If there is something that you would like to hear then mail the mailing list at hpr@hackerpublicradio.org (which you can join at http://hackerpublicradio.org/maillist ) or just email admin@hackerpublicradio.org and we'll add it to the Requested topic page. 

For the record when we say topic we are not talking about the topic choclate bar.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_(chocolate_bar) 

 

After discovering that HPR has a explicit tag in iTunes (http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html#explicit) the conversation took a turn to how the topic of Adult content and that there are two sides to the story.
http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0069 There's Pr0n on them there internets!
http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0586 Miscellaneous Radio Theater 4096- The Internet is For Porn 

This lead to the question of whither government censorship will force developments in how the Internet is used. This brought up mesh networks (we had a discussion in http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0069 with Juergen Schinker open wireless network) and how the Chaos Computer Club had a presentation on the Hackerspace Global Grid. From their FAQ "We want to build a distributed network of ground stations to receive satellite communications. The first step is establishing a means of accurate synchronization for the distributed network. Next up are building various receiver modules (ADS-B, amateur satellites, etc) and data processing of received signals. A communication/control channel (read: sending data) is a future possibility but there are no fixed plans on how this could be implemented yet." http://shackspace.de/wiki/doku.php?id=project:hgg Hackerspace Global Grid. Sounds a bit like an open version of the Iridium satellite constellation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_satellite_constellation Iridium satellite constellation


After a discussion on Google+, the topic came on whither you needed to encode all 3 audio formats for HPR. The answer is no, not if you don't want to. If you do then you can download the script that Code Cruncher made from http://hackerpublicradio.org/incoming/processing/prep_audio.sh. That said it's enough to upload the show in almost any format and we'll convert it. 

To round off the segment was a discussion of the http://theflatearthsociety.org/ who argue that "The Flat Earth model is a belief that the Earth's shape is a plane or disk." (source wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_Theory. 
 .... Which inevitably lead to the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down and of course that had to lead to http://www.terrypratchett.co.uk/ Terry Pratchett. At that point the Mumble server gave up and decided to go cry in a corner.

Philip Newborough (aka corenominal) project lead for CrunchBang Linux and their community manager Rebecca Newborough join the session. We interviewed them back in hpr0873 

CrunchBang is a Debian GNU/Linux based distribution offering a great blend of speed, style and substance. Using the nimble Openbox window manager, it is highly customisable and provides a modern, full-featured GNU/Linux system without sacrificing performance.

In September 2011, Philip gave up paid employment to concentrate on personal projects and is now working full-time on CrunchBang Linux. During the interview he mentioned that he couldn't afford to FOSDEM so if you want you can throw him a few credits over at http://crunchbang.org/donate

Apple Lisa

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa
 The Apple Lisa - also known as the Lisa - is a personal computer designed by Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple, Inc.) during the early 1980s.
 Development of the Lisa began in 1978 as a powerful personal computer with a graphical user interface (GUI) targeted toward business customers.
 In 1982, Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, so he joined the Macintosh project instead. The Macintosh is not a direct descendant of Lisa, although there are obvious similarities between the systems and the final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.
 The Lisa was a more advanced system than the Macintosh of that time in many respects, such as its inclusion of protected memory, cooperative multitasking, a generally more sophisticated hard disk based operating system, a built-in screensaver, an advanced calculator with a paper tape and RPN, support for up to two megabytes (MB) of RAM, expansion slots, a numeric keypad, data corruption protection schemes such as block sparing, non-physical file names (with the ability to have multiple documents with the same name), and a larger higher-resolution display. It would be many years before many of those features were implemented on the Macintosh platform. Protected memory, for instance, did not arrive until the Mac OS X operating system was released in 2001. The Macintosh featured a faster 68000 processor (7.89 MHz) and sound. The complexity of the Lisa operating system and its programs taxed the 5 MHz Motorola 68000 microprocessor so that consumers said it felt sluggish, particularly when scrolling in documents.

TRS-80

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_80
 TRS-80 was Tandy Corporation's desktop microcomputer model line, sold through Tandy's Radio Shack stores in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The first units, ordered unseen, were delivered in November 1977, and rolled out to the stores the third week of December. The line won popularity with hobbyists, home users, and small-businesses. Tandy Corporation's leading position in what Byte Magazine called the "1977 Trinity" (Apple, Commodore and Tandy) had much to do with Tandy's retailing the computer through more than 3000 of its Radio Shack (Tandy in Europe) storefronts. Notable features of the original TRS-80 included its full-stroke QWERTY keyboard, small size, its Floating Point BASIC programming language, an included monitor, and a starting price of $600. The pre-release price was $500 and a $50 deposit was required, with a money back guarantee at time of delivery. One major drawback of the original system was the massive RF interference it caused in surrounding electronics. This became a problem when it was determined to violate FCC regulations, leading to the Model I's phase out in favor of the new Model III. 
 By 1979, the TRS-80 had the largest available selection of software in the microcomputer market.
 ....
 In July 1980 Tandy released the Model III. The improvements of the Model III over the Model I included built-in lower case, a better keyboard, 1500-baud cassette interface, and a faster (2.03 MHz) Z-80 processor. With the introduction of the Model III, Model I production was discontinued as it did not comply with new FCC regulations as of 1 January 1981 regarding electromagnetic interference. The Model I radiated so much interference that while playing games an AM radio placed next to the computer could be used to provide sounds.
 The Model III could run about 80% of Model I software, but used an incompatible disk format. Customers and developers complained of bugs in its BASIC and the TRSDOS operating system. The computer also came with the option of integrated disk drives. Since they took power from the same supply as the motherboard and screen, which was not upgraded for the disk drive models, it was common to see the screen image shrink noticeably during drive access.

Commadore 128

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128
 The Commodore 128 (C128, CBM 128, C=128) home/personal computer was the last 8-bit machine commercially released by Commodore Business Machines (CBM). Introduced in January 1985 at the CES in Las Vegas, it appeared three years after its predecessor, the bestselling Commodore 64. 
 The C128 was a significantly expanded successor to the C64 and unlike the earlier Commodore Plus/4, nearly full compatibility with the C64 was retained, in both hardware and software. The new machine featured 128 KB of RAM, in two 64 KB banks and an 80-column RGBI video output (driven by the 8563 VDC chip with 16 KB dedicated video RAM), as well as a substantially redesigned case and keyboard. Also included was a Zilog Z80 CPU which allowed the C128 to run CP/M, as an alternate to the usual Commodore BASIC environment. 
 The primary hardware designer of the C128 was Bil Herd, who had worked on the Plus/4. Other hardware engineers were Dave Haynie and Frank Palaia, while the IC design work was done by Dave DiOrio. The main Commodore system software was developed by Fred Bowen and Terry Ryan, while the CP/M subsystem was developed by Von Ertwine

The Count of Monte Cristo - HPR Volunteers | 2011-11-30


Welcome to syndicated Thursday on Hacker Public Radio

Each Thursday we play Syndicated creative commons content from around the web. If you know of some creative commons material that you would like to bring to the attention of the community then send an email to admin. 

Today we're going back in time, to a classic audio drama performance by the Mercury Theater and was originally aired in Aug 29, 1938. It is an adaptation of the classic novel The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas. 



Mercury Theatre

Orson Welles at old style microphone
 The Mercury Theatre was a theatre company founded in New York City in 1937 by Orson Welles and John Houseman. After a string of live theatrical productions, in 1938 the Mercury Theatre progressed into their best-known period as The Mercury Theatre on the Air, a radio series that included one of the most notable and infamous radio broadcasts of all time, The War of the Worlds, broadcast on October 30, 1938. The Mercury Theatre on the Air produced live radio dramas in 1938-1940 and again briefly in 1946. 

The Count of Monte Cristo

The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by Alexandre Dumas. It is often considered to be, along with The Three Musketeers, Dumas's most popular work. He completed the work in 1844. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.

photo of Dumas

The story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of 1815–1838 (from just before the Hundred Days through to the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book. An adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy and forgiveness, it tells of a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune and sets about getting revenge on the men who destroyed his life. However, his plans also have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, "The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood."

Trivial File Transfer Protocol

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol

Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a file transfer protocol known for its simplicity.[citation needed] It is generally used for automated transfer of configuration or boot files between machines in a local environment. Compared to FTP, TFTP is extremely limited, providing no authentication, and is rarely used interactively by a user.

 Due to its simple design, TFTP could be implemented using a very small amount of memory. It is therefore useful for booting computers such as routers which may not have any data storage devices. It is an element of the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) network boot protocol, where it is implemented in the firmware BIOS of the host's network card.

 It is also used to transfer small amounts of data between hosts on a network, such as IP phone firmware or operating system images when a remote X Window System terminal or any other thin client boots from a network host or server. The initial stages of some network based installation systems (such as Solaris Jumpstart, Red Hat Kickstart, Symantec Ghost and Windows NT's Remote Installation Services) use TFTP to load a basic kernel that performs the actual installation.

 TFTP was first defined in 1980 by IEN 133.[1] It is currently defined by RFC 1350. There have been some extensions to the TFTP protocol documented in later RFC's (see the section on Extensions, below). TFTP is based in part on the earlier protocol EFTP, which was part of the PUP protocol suite. TFTP support appeared first as part of 4.3 BSD.

 Due to the lack of security, it is dangerous to use it over the Internet. Thus, TFTP is generally only used on private, local networks.

Pre micro computer tech in the home #2 - MrGadgets | 2011-11-15


In today's show Mr Gadgets talks about the access children of the space age had to science 

The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments

a picture of the cover
 The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments was a children's chemistry book written in the 1960s by Robert Brent and illustrated by Harry Lazarus and published by Western Publishing in their Golden Books series. Many of the experiments contained in the book are now considered "dangerous for unsupervised children"[citation needed], and would not appear in a modern children's chemistry book[citation needed]. OCLC lists only 126 copies of this book in libraries worldwide.
 The book was a source of inspiration to David Hahn, nicknamed "the Radioactive Boy Scout" by the media, who tried to collect a sample of every chemical element and also built a model nuclear reactor, which led to the involvement of the authorities.

Pat Volkerding of Slackware Linux chats with Klaatu - klaatu | 2011-11-08


Pat Volkerding of Slackware Linux chats with Klaatu and whomever happens to wander by (Maco, Vincent Batts, Chad Wallenberg, and others) at the SELF afterparty.


Slackware

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Slackware is a free and open source Linux-based operating system. It was one of the earliest operating systems to be built on top of the Linux kernel and is the oldest currently being maintained. Slackware was created by Patrick Volkerding of Slackware Linux, Inc. in 1993. The current stable version is 13.37, released on April 27, 2011.
 Slackware aims for design stability and simplicity, and to be the most "Unix-like" Linux distribution, making as few modifications as possible to software packages from upstream and using plain text files and a small set of shell scripts for configuration and administration. 
photo of Pat Volkerding 

Warning: this is not a proper interview, just 40 minutes of aimless and fairly noisy chit chat at a party. So it's probably not for everyone, although if you're a Slackware fan then it might be of some interest.

Another Tech Giant Passes - Household Tech in the Pre-Micro Era - MrGadgets | 2011-11-03


In today's show Mr Gadgets pauses to remember the passing of some pioneering greats in the tech field. He focuses on personal heroes who have had a profound impact on the direction of his life.

Edgar Villchur

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Villchur) 

Edgar Marion Villchur (28 May 1917 - 17 October 2011) was an American inventor, educator, and writer widely known for his 1954 invention of the acoustic suspension loudspeaker which revolutionized the field of high-fidelity equipment. A speaker Villchur developed, the AR-3, is exhibited at the The Smithsonian Institutions Information Age Exhibit in Washington, DC.
 Villchur's speaker systems provided improved bass response while reducing the speaker's cabinet size. Acoustic Research, Inc. (AR), of which he was president from 1954 to 1967, manufactured high-fidelity loudspeakers, turntables, and other stereo components of his design, and demonstrated their quality through live vs. recorded concerts. The companys market share grew to 32 percent by 1966. After leaving AR, Villchur researched hearing aid technology, developing the multichannel compression hearing aid, which became the industry standard for hearing aids. 

Henry Kloss

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kloss) 

Henry Kloss (1929, Altoona, PA - January 31, 2002, Cambridge, MA) was a prominent American audio engineer and businessman who helped advance high fidelity loudspeaker and radio receiver technology beginning in the 1950s. Kloss (pronounced with a long o, like "close") was an undergraduate student in physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (class of 1953), but never received a degree. He was responsible for a number of innovations, including the acoustic suspension loudspeaker and the high fidelity cassette deck. In 2000, Kloss was one of the first inductees into the Consumer Electronics Association's Hall of Fame. He earned an Emmy Award for his development of a projection television system, the Advent Video Beam 1000. 

Acoustic Research

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_Research) 

Acoustic Research was a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company that manufactured high-end audio equipment. The brand is now owned by Audiovox. Acoustic Research was well known for the AR-3 series of speaker systems, which used the 12-inch (305 mm) acoustic suspension woofer of the AR-1 with newly designed dome mid-range and high-frequency drivers, which were the first of their kind. AR's line of acoustic suspension speakers were extraordinary for their time, as they were the first loudspeakers with flat response, extended bass, wide dispersion, small size, and reasonable cost.

Open Source Radio Software - AukonDK | 2011-10-27


In todays show AukonDK leads us on a tour of Open Source Radio Software 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Icecast http://www.icecast.org/
 Icecast, the project, is a collection of programs and libraries for streaming audio over the Internet. This includes: 
•icecast, a program that streams audio data to listeners 
•libshout, a library for communicating with Icecast servers 
•IceS, a program that sends audio data to Icecast servers 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUTT http://butt.sourceforge.net/
 butt (broadcast using this tool) is an easy to use, multi OS streaming tool.
 It supports ShoutCast and IceCast.
 butt runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDJC http://idjc.sourceforge.net/


Internet DJ Console is a project started in March 2005 to provide a powerful yet easy to use source-client for individuals interested in streaming live radio shows over the Internet using Shoutcast or Icecast servers.

Because of the large number of streaming applications that already existed but did little more than stream a pair of audio channels or a fixed playlist, it was decided that IDJC would be the opposite and simulate audio hardware to cut down the expense of creating a home studio.

In addition to providing a large number of show production features, this software has been written with the aim of producing the best possible experience for the listeners and DJ alike. To that end features like VoIP integration were conceived of from the very start resulting in the choice of Jack Audio Connection Kit to base the audio.

This has afforded IDJC audio processing capabilities that were they built in would be considered excessive. Enjoy integration with powerful programs such as the well known Skype, Jack Rack (offering audio sound effects plugins), Jamin (the powerful audio compressor/equalizer), and many more.

Fortunately IDJCs power does not come at the expense of a well organized user interface, nor have requests for features been permitted to diminish the application's intuitive feel yet throughout development the main goals have always been that of stability and audio quality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Liquidsoap http://savonet.sourceforge.net/index.html


Liquidsoap is a powerful and flexible language for describing your streams. It offers a rich collection of operators that you can combine at will, giving you more power than you need for creating or transforming streams. But liquidsoap is still very light and easy to use, in the Unix tradition of simple strong components working together. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Airtime http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime/


Airtime is the open radio software for scheduling and remote station management. Remote access to the station’s media management, multi-file upload and automatic metadata verification is coupled with a collaborative online scheduling calendar and playlist management. The scheduling calendar is managed through an easy-to-use web-interface and triggers audio playout with sub-second precision for fading.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rivendell http://www.rivendellaudio.org/
Rivendell  is a complete radio broadcast automation solution, with facilities for the acquisition, management, scheduling and playout of audio content. It has all of the features one would expect in a modern, fully-fledged radio automation system, including support for both PCM and MPEG audio encoding, full voicetracking and log customization as well as support for a wide variety of third party software and hardware. As a robust, functionally complete digital audio system for broadcast radio applications, Rivendell uses industry standard components like the GNU/Linux Operating System, the AudioScience HPI Driver Architecture and the MySQL Database Engine. Rivendell is available under the GNU Public License. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RAAbuntu http://rrabuntu.sourceforge.net/


Rivendell Radio Automation Live CD installer for Ubuntu. This is a modified version of Ubuntu 10.04. It has been customised using the Ubuntu Customization Kit (UCK) and the Rivendell DEB packages developed by Alban in France. http://blog.tryphon.org/alban/ 

Frederick Henderson created all the install scripts for the greatly improved installer

Jamey Sharp Interview at X.Org Developer Conference (XDC) 2011 - marcoz | 2011-09-29


Jamey Sharp was placed on Ritalin, briefly, in fifth grade. His interests and activities have been varied ever since. Today his day job involves a computer test for attention deficit disorder, but his biggest projects have been the Portland State Aerospace Society, a student rocketry club at Portland State University; XCB, a new low-level binding to the X protocol, in the process of replacing Xlib; and Serialist, because his other projects didn’t leave him enough time to read his favorite webcomics without tool support.
 Jamey’s interests span computer science fields including cryptography, combinatorial search, compilers, and computational complexity; systems-level programming, such as file format and network protocol implementations, Linux kernel development, and boot-loader hacking; computer architecture and its impact on software design; and functional programming, preferably in Haskell.
 This interview focuses on Jamey's work on X.org, specifically the XCB project. The X protocol C-language Binding (XCB) is a replacement for Xlib featuring a small footprint, latency hiding, direct access to the protocol, improved threading support, and extensibility.

Sansa Clip Plus for podcasting - pokey | 2011-09-20


Long story short is that the Clip+ is pretty great as a cheap all-in-one recording device. I go into a little more detail here, and I have an idea that may make it even better. 

Since recording this, I have discovered how to change the recording directory. 
1.Press the Home button to get to the main menu. 
2.Go to the "Files" option in the main menu, and navigate to the directory (even if it's on the SD card) that you want to use for recording. Highlight it, but don't open it. 
3.Hold down the center button to open a context menu. 
4.Scroll down and select "Set As Recording Directory".

Interview with Yancy Smith - Broam | 2011-09-06


Cheapskate Computing 

Transcriber's notes: This is probably 95%-97% accurate. I made sure to get most of the important parts, even slowing down the recording - but some stuff just did not come out clearly. We were in a very quiet room, but the Fuze's mic is not professional quality. Transcriptions marked with an asterisk * are my best guess / paraphrase. There aren't many. 

The Carolina Free PC organization that Yancy mentions can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/carolinafreepc/ 

Audio notes: Volume normalization & removal of bias, and the noise of me pressing buttons on the Fuze was removed. There is no editing for content. 

Broam: So hi, I'm here with Yancy Smith, he was doing a...like a donation project he called the "Scrapper Project" here at SELF, I just wanted to ask him a couple questions about it. 

Broam: Hi Yancy. 

Yancy: Hi. Um. 

Broam: So tell me about it. 

Yancy: Well basically we take the time*, we take old computers from labs and computer stores, they give them to me; I recycle them to someone else. 

And a couple weeks ago I got clearance in talking Dave Yates, our president, said, "can we do this here at our function" here at SELF. and I sent out to all our club members and to most of my facebook friends, we didn't put on the general list, we just tryin' this out. We didn't have no donations this time, but some of us bought some stuff in, mainly me, brought some old stuff in, to get rid of because I don't have the room...and... it didn't turn out so well, but had a couple of bags to send with the Athens [?] team home, so they enjoyed that. 

Broam: That's cool. I have some other questions here... let's see here... um. so professional. So is this mostly you organizing this on your own, or? 

Yancy: Yeah. But I'm working with the Carolina Free PC Foundation. I emailed them, they said they would be glad to take, and they emailed me back. Emailed Athens a week ago, but they didn't get my email in time, but they said next year, talk to such & such and they would know who to talk to. I'd be willing to open it to anyone. 

Broam: Okay. Is this the first year you've done this, or? 

Yancy: Yeah, it's first time. It's an ad-hoc thing, our group - the club, Upstate Carolina Linux user group. ( www.uclug.org ), is a meritocracy, but I still asked for permission. 

Broam: Cool obviously crossing off a ton of questions here and who are you going to give the donated computers to? Other foundations, or? 

Yancy: Mainly, um, if there had been some this year, there would have been a three-way split - who needs what parts. I found out that the Carolina [group] wanted the hard drives and certain memory sets and things, they would have gotten that. Free PCs they had certain amounts that wanted, and the rest I would have taken home or send on to someone else down the road. 

Broam: Ok. And uh, and did you look at any other projects - I know you contacted some people, but did you look at other, like, similar things that people have done on line, like, say Freegeek or Helios Initiative for anything like that, for ideas? 

Yancy: Mainly it's between, um, I haven't heard of them too much; but like what I said I'm following the guidelines of the Carolina PC and some of the Athens stuff. I happen to know um, what we - I had contact with them last year and so if there's something they can use... 

Broam: Ok. You said something in the Facebook post you sent me about Linux being required by South Carolina state law. Could you explain that a little more? 

Yancy: Well it's... that was a misstatement. What I was saying was that by State law requires you to send off the parts and metals stuff, not in the trash they send it off to a scrapyard - 

Broam: Oh, ok... yeah I... 

Yancy: but the part about the Linux is I put Linux on there because it wipes the drive down completely and clearly because of the data retention laws, that's why 

Broam: aaaah, ok. 

Yancy: see a lot of the stores, I go into a thift store, like a Goodwill or a church store, they don't really wipe down the systems they build. They don't have the [expertise]. They just wipe* a couple directories and think it's sanitized. That is a dangeorus thing to do. 

Broam: Yes, I know... (In retrospect, sounds kinda flippant, sorry. I meant to agree with him here. ed.) 

Yancy: That and the license - any issues of rebuilding windows, I do that only when I have a holographic key. So it's just like even if I have a key I still put Linux on top of it, so if there's an issue with Windows, I can recover but also I still can introduce them to Linux, because games, software, photos... 

Broam: Everything is free, everything is legally transferrable. 

Yancy: Yeah. Especially there's an application called Photo...photo wall or photoroom, it's sorta like Apple's album* for all your photos. It's the coolest thing. 

Broam: Cool! And I have one last question ...got any stuff for me? 

Yancy: Um... 

Broam: *laughter* 

Yancy: Not much left. Athens took off with all of my stuff. 

Broam: All right. Thanks a lot, Yancy. I appreciate your time.

Circuit Bending - NewAgeTechnoHippie | 2011-07-18


I realize that what I have done is not truly circuit bending, but I felt that it was interesting and 

was the closest related topic to my hacking. 





Tools I have used:

Precission Screw drivers: flat,philips, torx, triwing, and allen

knife or wire cutter

soldering iron

electrical tape

package of various resitors

varialbe resistors ( potentiometers)

Capacitors

super glue





Here are some links that may be useful for this type of hacking.

Mischief Managed - Thistleweb | 2011-07-17


With Customs in various countries acting as Copyright Cops, using any excuse to rifle through your personal and private data not only for threats, but copyright infringement. Wouldn't it be great to have invisible ink? You can get your private data through Customs, under the scrutiny of the Copyright Cops while also being a fully cooperative model citizen.

ThistleWeb discusses three ways to do this with the drawbacks of each.
•Using a Cloud service of some sort to store your data on as you travel, where you upload then download after going through Customs.
•Using a decoy user account on your regular installed distro
•Using a decoy distro as a dual boot

Harry Potter got the Marauders Map in book three, which transforms to blank parchment with a tap of the wand the words "mischief managed" so nobody knows it's a dynamic map of Hogwarts and it's inhabitants. Now your laptop or netbook can have the same invisible ink qualities.

So repeat after me "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!"

Just like the GPL, use at your own risk.

NAME 
       sort - sort lines of text files
 
SYNOPSIS 
       sort [OPTION]... [FILE]...
       sort [OPTION]... --files0-from=F
 
DESCRIPTION 
       Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.
 
       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.  Ordering options:
 
       -b, --ignore-leading-blanks
	      ignore leading blanks
 
       -d, --dictionary-order
	      consider only blanks and alphanumeric characters
 
       -f, --ignore-case
	      fold lower case to upper case characters
 
       -g, --general-numeric-sort
	      compare according to general numerical value
 
       -i, --ignore-nonprinting
	      consider only printable characters
 
       -M, --month-sort
	      compare (unknown) < `JAN' < ... < `DEC'
 
       -n, --numeric-sort
	      compare according to string numerical value
 
       -R, --random-sort
	      sort by random hash of keys
 
       --random-source=FILE
	      get random bytes from FILE
 
       -r, --reverse
	      reverse the result of comparisons
 
       --sort=WORD
	      sort according to WORD: general-numeric -g,  month  -M,  numeric
	      -n, random -R, version -V
 
       -V, --version-sort
	      natural sort of (version) numbers within text
 
       Other options:
 
       --batch-size=NMERGE
	      merge at most NMERGE inputs at once; for more use temp files
 
       -c, --check, --check=diagnose-first
	      check for sorted input; do not sort
 
       -C, --check=quiet, --check=silent
	      like -c, but do not report first bad line
 
       --compress-program=PROG
	      compress temporaries with PROG; decompress them with PROG -d
 
       --files0-from=F
	      read  input  from the files specified by NUL-terminated names in
	      file F; If F is - then read names from standard input
 
       -k, --key=POS1[,POS2]
	      start a key at POS1 (origin 1), end it at POS2 (default  end  of
	      line)
 
       -m, --merge
	      merge already sorted files; do not sort
 
       -o, --output=FILE
	      write result to FILE instead of standard output
 
       -s, --stable
	      stabilize sort by disabling last-resort comparison
 
       -S, --buffer-size=SIZE
	      use SIZE for main memory buffer
 
       -t, --field-separator=SEP
	      use SEP instead of non-blank to blank transition
 
       -T, --temporary-directory=DIR
	      use  DIR	for temporaries, not $TMPDIR or /tmp; multiple options
	      specify multiple directories
 
       -u, --unique
	      with -c, check for strict ordering; without -c, output only  the
	      first of an equal run
 
       -z, --zero-terminated
	      end lines with 0 byte, not newline
 
       --help display this help and exit
 
       --version
	      output version information and exit
 
       POS  is	F[.C][OPTS],  where  F is the field number and C the character
       position in the field; both are origin 1.  If neither -t nor -b	is  in
       effect,	characters  in	a  field are counted from the beginning of the
       preceding whitespace.  OPTS  is	one  or  more  single-letter  ordering
       options,  which	override  global ordering options for that key.  If no
       key is given, use the entire line as the key.
 
       SIZE may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes: % 1%  of
       memory, b 1, K 1024 (default), and so on for M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y.
 
       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
 
       ***  WARNING  ***  The locale specified by the environment affects sort
       order.  Set LC_ALL=C to get the traditional sort order that uses native
       byte values.

Botnets and DNS Tunnelling - finux and code.cruncher | 2011-06-13


HPR podcasting: "It's just as easy as getting two geeks onto skype!"

Finux Tech Weekly podcast: http://www.finux.co.uk/

BOTNETS
 53% increase in command and control servers in Canada

This number was published by Websense. They decided to invest the situation after seeing an increase in targeted attacks against the Canadian government.

Interesting Statistics!

Wingz - MrGadgets | 2011-06-09


Company: Innovative Software (Primary: software suite smart software)
 Product: Wingz a spreadsheet software
 First for the Mac, stupidest possible product, because there already was Excel
 They hired Leonard Nimoy for the ad video, because Wingz was all about the future
 They had a Wingz bag in different colors , which was awarded laptop accessory of the year one year by Jerry Pournelle (scifi writer) in the Chaos Manor column he wrote for BYTE Magazine.
 After two years the Wingz Software came out, also for Os2 and Windows and was very successful, up to 15% of the Mac market 
 A special feature was that it could connect to databases


and the lesson learned ... (not to be spoiled here, listen to the podcast)

Linux Packaging Systems (too many) - marcoz | 2011-05-24


Packaging systems:
 rpm, rpm5, deb/dpkg, ebuild, compressed files (archlinux), pisi, .tgz (tar.gz file) slackware/vector linux, .tlz (Vector Linux)

Package managers:
 Program Distro(s) website notes
 apt debian 
 conary Foresight Liux/rPath company handles distributed repositories, commit/rollback
 entropy Sabayon consists of Equo client (textual), Sulfur client (graphical) 
 kpackagekit kubuntu uses policykit (any problems if booted computer from a live cd and mounted and chroot'd?)
 opkg openmoko lightweight; based on ipkg
 pacman archlinux
 pirut fedora it calls yum so it's just a gui wrapper? not sure how widely used...?
 pisi pardus (Turkish distro) was based on gentoo. as far as I can tell it now uses its own pkg format
 poldek Fedora RPM
 portage gentoo ebuilds,
 slapt slackware tgz
 slapt vectorlinux tlz;
 smart UnityLinux RPM5
 synaptic ubuntu DEB; graphical frontend to apt
 urpmi mandriva RPM
 yum redhat/fedora RPM
 zypper opensuse RPM

Concerns:
 1) package burn out - will it get to the point where only either large distros or commercial distros have large repos due to the effort involved?
 2) I've lost track of the number of times i've heard from people 'our distro doesn't have enough manpower to package ...'
 wouldn't it be helpful to not have to use our limited manpower in building redundant packages?
 3) in 10 (or less) years when non-technical people take over at Redhat/Ubuntu/other large distro, will they use the package system as a club to beat the other distros with? I'm not sure how, but where money is involved, you can feel assured it _will_ happen.
 4) current state of packaging systems in linux is like sound systems were 10 yrs ago.
 remember esd vs arts vs vs ...? each desktop environment had its own system. sound in linux was painful and a complete joke. it still has a ways to go but it's _SO_ much better now that it was. does anyone want to go back to that?
 pulseaudio isn't perfect but it's so much better than what we had before. and it's ONE system!
 can you image if printing and authentication were like the packaging systems? image if everyone had their own printing system instead of CUPs? imagine if there was no pam.d?
 5) I believe packaging systems are NOT about choice. the exact opposite. it's about vendor lockin and NIH. 
 (we'll do it OUR way because we can do it better or the 'proper' way. "so-and-so does blah, which is
 completely stupid")
 choice is being able to write a script in php,perl,python,bash,csh,... on the SAME system. 
 that's choice 
 because I can CHOOSE. If I have a debian box I can't choose to use RPM or ebuilds, same for those other systems.
 of the systems I've used: deb, rpm, rpm5, portage, (and tarballs if you count linuxfromscratch)
 and the managers I've used: yum, urpmi, smart, kpackagekit, synaptic, apt-get, emerge
 each system has little features the others don't. but there is nothing that one system has that couldn't be added to the others.

Please forgive the audio quality of this recording. Due to the acoustics of the room, and my crappy mic, I had to "massage" the recording an awful lot to be able to hear all three people at a reasonable level without overwhelming you with background noise. I did my best. 

I want to thank Donald and Matt for making it such a great interview. They were firendly, respectful, and kind. I had a great time with them durring the interview, and at the afterparty. They represent the FSF well.

How I Found Linux - code.cruncher | 2011-04-06


After years of using Unix, Mac, and Windows I finally converted my two Windows computers to Linux for real. 
 The journey into Linux started with not being successful at writing a startup script for Linux. A few years later I discovered some Linux love when writing a driver that would make the keyboard LED lights blink the morse code of the letters being typed. A year ago I did a few virtual Linux installations (archLinux, Debian) in VirtualBox to test out some Cloud Computing stuff. Before Christmas 2010, I was considering contributing to the KDE project and installed Kubuntu as well as Ubuntu. 
 This year, because I am going to the LinuxFest NorthWest (and I am going to have a table there for HackerPublicRadio) I had to install Linux on my old Windows Laptop. I also converted my Samsung Q1 Ultra Tablet computer from WindowsXP to Ubuntu. 
 Both conversions were successful, but a few problems had to be solved for which https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu is a great place to go and find or get answers. 

BTW: If you're going to http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/ please come and say "hi" at the HPR table and if you can help out at the table please let me know code.cruncher_hpr at yahoo ca.

Resources for Autodidacts - Curbuntu | 2011-03-25


Proposal for a new HPR "series"

What web resources (instructional sites, podcasts, video tutorials) and dead-tree resources have you found helpful in learning Linux, programming, and F/LOSS software?  In the tradition of our standard contributor podcasts (like “How I Got Started with Linux” or “My First Computer”), Curbuntu proposes an ongoing category in which we share these learning resources with each other.

The topic is kicked off with these suggestions:
•The Hewlett-Packard Learning Center (http://h30187.www3.hp.com/all_courses.jsp).  While signing in with a username and password is required, the courses at the site are free.
•The ODFAuthors.org site (http://www.odfauthors.org), the place to find outstanding, comprehensive, and (best of all) free manuals for the various OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice modules like Writer, Calc, and Impress.
•An example of the printed, for-pay versions of the ODFAuthors.org books can be found at http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/openofficeorg-3-writer-guide/6570202.

Product Review SunVolt - riddlebox | 2011-03-18


Today, I am going to do a product review today, this product is one that I think almost anyone will find a good use for! The product is from Scosche, and is the Solar-Powered Universal Charger/ Backup Battery or SunVolt.

Python Response to Bad Apples Podcast 5x18 - Doug Farrell | 2011-03-04


In episode 5X18 of the Bad Apples podcast, Klaatu challenged me to create my own podcast explaining my Python version of his bash script. His bash script created a list of files that matched a file name pattern, then read the first line from each of those files and wrote that to an output file. My Python program does exactly the same thing, but in Python.
 Here is the body of that program with the comments stripped out:
#!/usr/bin/python
import glob
outfile = open("toc.output", "w")
for filename in glob.glob("*.txt"):
    outfile.write(open(filename).readline())


The above text can be used to follow along with the audio of the podcast. Here is the English explanation version of the above program:

•Tell the system the rest of the text in the file should interpreted by Python
•Import the glob module, which is one of the library modules that comes with Python
•Create a new file object called "toc.output" that we can write to
•Iterate over the list of files that match the pattern "*.txt" created by the glob function, and assign each matching file in turn to the filename variable
•Open each filename, read the first line from the file and write it to our previously opened output file.
It's not shown above, but each matching filename that we open is closed at the end of the looping construct. In addtion, the output file is also closed at the end of the programs execution. 
 Hopefully you enjoyed the podcast!

Book Review

The book is Badge Of Infamy by Lester Del Rey and read by Steven Wilson. It is available from podiobooks.com. The direct url is http://www.podiobooks.com/title/badge-of-infamy. 
 From podiobooks.com: "Daniel Feldman was a doctor once. He made the mistake of saving a friend's life in violation of Medical Lobby rules. Now, he's a pariah, shunned by all, forbidden to touch another patient. But things are more loose on Mars. There, Doc Feldman is welcomed by the colonists, even as he's hunted by the authorities. But, when he discovers a Martian plague may soon wipe out humanity on two planets, the authorities begin hunting him for a different reason altogether."

Salvaging old Coleman lanterns and stoves - brother mouse | 2011-02-21


This show discusses getting neglected lanterns/stoves back into running condition. It is not about restoring them to pretty, like-new, "shelf queen" condition. 

errata and clarifications, roughly timecoded

@18mins - The little cup is to hold alcohol, which is burned to "prime" the system. The burning alcohol preheats the generator so the higher- flashpoint kero can ignite without drama. 

s/sided lantern/sided globe/g 

@19mins - s/possible/practical/ 

@20mins - varnish might be removed by sitting in fresh fuel, or more likely by sitting in 90% isopropyl or methanol. I filter the alcohol after use and use it to prime kero gear, as above. 

@27mins - the generator can get internally gummed up, particularly when running unleaded in a unit not designed for that. 

@29mins - black _body_ luminosity 

@30mins - might want to plug the air tube on a stored suitcase stove to block the progress of the aforementioned spiders. 

s/impermeable/impervious/ 

@33mins this isn't that unusual; stove/lantern fettlers skew older, demographically speaking

DD-WRT - Xoke | 2011-02-15


Apologies for the bad quality. I really was installing DD-WRT whilst recording, for the first time! I tried to tidy it up but it’s still fairly rough!
1.Go the the DD-WRT website.
2.Go to Router Database.
3.Search for your Router (or one you might want to buy), in my case the Linksys WRT54GL from NewEgg (note: NOT a sponsored link and other shops are available).
4.Read this stuff: http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=51486
5.Notes: Initial flashing ‘Mini Generic’ via web interface. Give it at least 2 mins after reboot!
6.Installation guide: http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Installation
7.Lifehacker article: http://lifehacker.com/178132/hack-attack-turn-your-60-router-into-a-600-router
8.Short version: 1.Plug in the router
2.Install the mini-generic DD-WRT firmware
3.Reboot the router if it doesn’t restart itself
4.Install the full DD-WRT firmware. It should restart
5.Enjoy the shininess of the new firmware!
6.Reset the password and username!


Thoughts.
•The router restarts itself when you flash the firmware, which is nice.
•If you change the IP of the router you may have to disconnect and reconnect the network through linux to force it to update the new IP address. Don’t forget like I did!

•To set up a Wii via Wi-Fi you need to set the router up as ‘Ad-Hoc’ else it doesn’t seem to show in the Wii menu.
•I had problems with my previous router being 192.168.1.1 and the DSL being 192.168.0.1 making me hard reset and set the details back up. Might be unrelated to this, however changing the IP to 192.168.10.1 for the router and keeping 192.168.0.1 for the DSL resolved this problem.
•It was pretty damn simple! At least a lot simple and faster then installing windows!
•Total time isn’t too long, but I’d recommend having a second router on hand (if you can) to keep internet access in case things go hairy!

An argument against emulators when retrocomputing - Trixter | 2011-02-11


I was moved by Ken Fallon's cry for submissions, so here's my first podcast: An argument against using emulators when retrocomputing. In short, there are some semi-intangible things you can't get from an emulator that you can only get from the real hardware, so use real hardware when you can. Examples contained within. 

Mentioned or hinted at on the show: 

Andrew Jenner's proposal to rewrite the CRTC emulation for MESS: http://www.reenigne.org/blog/crtc-emulation-for-mess/ 

Ian Bogost's work on adding more realistic display techniques to Stella, a 2600 emulator: http://www.bogost.com/games/a_television_simulator.shtml

Wput: a command-line ftp-client - Ken Fallon | 2011-01-26


Wput is a command-line ftp-client that looks like wget but instead of downloading, uploads files or whole directories to remote ftp-servers. 

Main Features
•wget-like interface
•TLS-encryption
•resuming
•speed-limit
•time-stamping (compares local and remote dates)
•proxy-support (socks5, http)
•i18n
•windows-compatibility

Wput is a free utility that is able to upload files to a ftp-server.
 
Wput is non−interactive and background-capable. It can upload files or whole directories and is meant to be a robust client even for unstable connections and will therefore retry to upload a file, if the connection broke.
 
Wput supports resuming, so it automatically continues uploading from the point where the previous upload stopped, meaning that you can kill Wput anytime and it will (if the remote ftp−server supports this, being most likely the case) finish the partial uploaded file.
 
Wput supports connections through proxies, allowing you to use it in an environment that can access the internet only via a proxy or to provide anonymity by hiding your ip−address to the server. For SOCKSv5−proxies Wput supports also listening mode, allowing you to use port-mode ftp through a proxy (useful if the remote ftp is behind a firewall or a gateway).
 
Wput supports timestamping, so it will (in the ideal case and if timestamping is enabled) only upload files, that are newer than the remote-file.
 
The upload-rate of Wput can be restricted, so that Wput won’t eat all available bandwidth.

Hacking Your Suburban Backyard with Chickens - brother mouse | 2011-01-18


Remember that feeling you got when you compiled your first executable and ran that sucker? You can get that feeling again every time you reach in the nestbox and pull out a freshly laid egg from birds you tend with your own hands. "Roll your own" eggs, then "share and enjoy" the surplus.

Topics covered:

2.Benefits of backyard chickening
3.Challenges and misconceptions
4.What you need (hardware): coop or tractor, feeders/waterers, materials
5.What you need (wetware): chicks v. pullets v. hens.
6.Breeds: egg production, meat production, dual purpose, ornamentals

The Endura's blade is less than 4" from tip to handle, making it compliant with most pocketknife laws. Be sure to check your local laws and measure your blade including the tang, because a LEO might do the same. It has been said, wisely, "You might beat the rap, but you won't beat the ride."

Kid3-qt - pokey | 2011-01-10


An id3 tag is meta-data attached to an audio file, and is (ideally) about the file to which it is attached. If you've ever tried to edit id3 tags through a media player, then you know what a pain that is. If you haven't... Well, now you never have to. Rejoice! Kid3-qt is an id3 tag editor, and it is awesome.

Installing Windows XP in VirtualBox - arfab | 2010-12-15


I use GNU/Linux for everything except one program that I need for work. Even the odd Windows games I've played run nicely in wine now, but not this. I have looked for Open Source alternatives but so far have not come across anything I can use in the same way so that means I have to have an install of Windows on hand just for this one purpose. 

In this podcast I am talking through setting up a virtual machine using VirtualBox, and installing Windows XP on that virtual machine. 

If you would like me to make further episodes on this topic, maybe installing a different OS, or how to tweak this WinXP install once it is up and running then please drop me a line either on Twitter or identi.ca; I am @arfab; or email me on: arfab@lavabit.com

So You Wanna Start A Band? - Thistleweb | 2010-12-14


Many people only think about it from the fans perspective, without realizing the different steps it's taken to get to them. ThistleWeb talks about the current copyright cartel thinking in how it affects musicians. The same people who claim to speak on behalf of artists, lobby to enshrine laws supposedly for the artists. He talks through the process of starting a band and how often these laws crop up forcing the next generation of musicians to spend a LOT of money to stay legal, or be criminalized. Staying legal means coughing up to maintain the status quo.

He ends with a brief comparison of how things can work under a Creative Commons license.

He forgot to mention the parallels with the Musicians Guild in Discworld by Terry Pratchett, who send the assassins in to deal with people who think they can play music without being paid members of the Guild.

alternative investing and how the internet changes the game - JWP | 2010-12-08

Shownotes from http://jwp5.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/alternative-investing-and-how-the-internet-changes-the-game/ 
For My hacker Public Radio spot.
Recently, I had a chance to review about 30 years of my investing and savings.
Being a live long member of the save 10% club and having been debt free for a number years I thought I needed a review.

Having been in the military I had picked almost all the wrong kinds of things to invest in in the pre-internet era that one could think of.
A few years ago when Ron Paul was running for President.
I stumbled upon his web site.
Having shared many views with Mr. Paul and him being a small town doctor from Texas.  I was very interested in what he invested in.
I read that he had about 50% of his assets in hard assets like Gold Coins and the rest T bills.
Of course he was debt free and owned his home and land out right as well.  

I use Etrade and I am slowy moving the mistakes of the Army.
Its just hard to get in touch with folks that deal with paper.

The reason I like Etrade so much is that they show the total loss or gain each investment right away.  No guessing you can see it.
You also pay as you go with them and it is very clear what you have to pay in total fee’s.

I like the treasury direct site as well.

But what really interested me.
Is what is coming.  And this is the Hacker part of that really says wow.
I have been a user of pay pal for a long time.
I have a German and American account with them and find its a great way to move dollars to euros with out a lot of over the top fees.
Most people do not think about having two types of money but I assure you the dollar is not worth very much today vs. the Euro.
Which is great for American Jobs.  
Being a Pay Pal user I a saw this Microplace site they have.
I used my pay pal ID and it worked.
There was no tricks or anything.  
You make a small loan to women in south texas or coco farms in the islands and they really pay you back.
I have done it for a few years and it made feel a lot better about sharing my money and getting a fair return.

I also look into owning a share of Windmill or truck or locomotive but the incoming costs are pretty high.  About 15K to starting in Germany to own a share of ship or locomotive.  I like this because its a set investment a train that works in the Hamburg harbor and its there you can go and see it on your web cam and see it work.  It pays back your entire principle over the 30 years of its life and it pays a share of the profit for that year.  I have not found very many American investments like that.  But have heard that some Oil trusts can do that.  Can I have a web cam of it working would be a qualifying point for me.  

Well enjoy and thank about it.
Keep it simple if you do save and watch fee’s.
The younger you start the easier it is.
And do not borrow money with credit cards or by car with credit or buy home unless you put 20% down. 
Would be the only other advice.
I read book one time about wealthy barber and another about a guy who saved three years living expenses.
I used much from both.  
The one that really changed my life was when I had the living expenses worked out.
It changed how I felt about my Boss and what I would be willing do a lot.  
The spirit to take chance also came from that.

In any case I am off enjoy and be safe.

sdf and openvms deathrow - JWP | 2010-11-08

first I wanted to share my contact information.
 and my rss feed to my show http://jwplinux.libsyn.com/rss
 I wanted to talk about two places that really helped me in learning about the command line. Both do not run linux one runs net bsd and the other runs open vms. Both are so geeky you need to beat it away with a stick.
 I use really often and have learned so much from the use of sdf public access unix system. It was first done up in 1987 and I really like it. I saw it once in Seatle it is great thing to view. If you liked the old compuserve you are going to love this place. Its free but if you donate I think 10 bucks you get a lot more out of it.
 The second place is death row vms I did a pod cast with bev a while back and its agreat place to do unix. its based on open vms which if you can not love it you must hate cute kittens to. Bev has a lot compilers there which can save you so bucks.
 Free raid storage at both places.
 free email at both places
 free IRC at both places#
 A lot that geeks like at both places

Shot of Hack – Changing the time offset of a series of photos - Ken Fallon | 2010-06-03

The problem: You have a series of photos where the time is offset from the correct time but is still correct in relation to each other.

Here are a few of the times that I’ve needed to do this:
- Changing the battery on my camera switched to a default date.
- I wanted to synchronize the time on my camera to a GPS track so the photos matched the timestamped coordinates.
- At a family event where images from different cameras were added together.

You can do edit the timestamp using a GUI and many photo manipulation applications like the GIMP support metadata editing. For example on KDE:

    gwenview -> plugins -> images -> metadata -> edit EXIF 

The problem is that this gets tiresome after a few images, and anyway the times are correct in relation to each other – I just need to add or subtract a time correction to them en masse.

The answer: exiv2 – Image metadata manipulation tool. It is a program to read and write Exif, IPTC and XMP image metadata and image comments.

user@pc:~$ exiv2 *.jpg
File name       : test.jpg
File size       : 323818 Bytes
MIME type       : image/jpeg
Image size      : 1280 x 960
Camera make     : FUJIFILM
Camera model    : MX-1200
Image timestamp : 2008:12:07 15:12:59
Image number    :
Exposure time   : 1/64 s
Aperture        : F4.5
Exposure bias   : 0 EV
Flash           : Fired
Flash bias      :
Focal length    : 5.8 mm
Subject distance:
ISO speed       : 160
Exposure mode   : Auto
Metering mode   : Multi-segment
Macro mode      :
Image quality   :
Exif Resolution : 1280 x 960
White balance   :
Thumbnail       : image/jpeg, 5950 Bytes
Copyright       :
Exif comment    :

The trick is to pick a image where you can that figure out what the time was and work out the time offset. In my case I needed to adjust the date forward by six months and four days while changing the time back by seven hours. I used the command exiv2 -O 6 -D 4 -a -7 *.jpg

-a time
    Time adjustment in the format [-]HH[:MM[:SS]].
    This option is only used with the 'adjust' action. Examples:
        1 adds one hour,
        1:01 adds one hour and one minute,
        -0:00:30 subtracts 30 seconds.
-Y yrs
    Time adjustment by a positive or negative number of years, for the 'adjust' action.
-O mon
    Time adjustment by a positive or negative number of months, for the 'adjust' action.
-D day
    Time adjustment by a positive or negative number of days, for the 'adjust' action.

When we run this we can see that the timestamp has now changed.

user@pc:~$ exiv2 *.jpg | grep timestamp
Image timestamp : 2009:06:11 08:12:59

That’s it. Remember this is the end of the conversation – to give feedback you can either record a show for the HPR network and email it to admin@hackerpublicradio.org or write it on a post-it note and attach it to the windscreen of Dave Yates’s car as he’s recording his next show.

BONUS EPISODE!

This episode was a bonus episode that I created just to work out the timing between seasons. We had completed the last season 3 at episode 156 (52 episodes * 3 years) but the first episode of season 4 (#157) was planned as a live event at hope NEXT week so I had a week gap with no show and I didn't want to ruin the live event, so I created this "half episode" to fill the slot this week.. This rare episode was streamed but was not on our archive. There may be a few copies floating around here or there, but this is the first official release of this episode on this site.

Cherokee And Asyncronous Servers - Thistleweb | 2009-09-14


ThistleWeb discusses the difference between process based and asynchronous servers, then goes on to talk about Cherokee server and a few flat file PHP applications.

•Cherokee Server
•Cherokee Ubuntu PPA
•XAMPP The one-click server for Linux, Windows or OSX.
•How to forge has plenty of tutorials, including a few on Cherokee.
•DokuWiki
•Nano CMS Project Homepage. This domain seems to have expired, so the code is hosted on Google for now.
•FlatPress

The Admin process:
•sudo cherokee-admin
•localhost:9090
•Copy and paste the temprary password.
•You can bind it (or a virtual server) to 127.0.0.1 if it's meant to be a private server.

I kept refering to "spawn-cgi" in the recording. This is supposed to be "spawn-fcgi". I also inferred that it didn't use config files, it does; it just generates them via the admin web GUI and will overwrite any changes made manually.

ThistleWeb explains 2 tips with the keypad / numblock function. First is numblockx, a simple app which remembers the status of the numblock key across reboots. This is already installed and running in many distros but if it's not it can be added. Second is CTRL+ALT+NUMLOCK which toggles the keypad into a different mode, allowing you to move the pointer with the keypad.

Numlockx 
•Numlockx Project Homepage
•OpenBox - /.config/openbox/autostart.sh
•numblockx &


Keyboard Pointer Control 
•Penguin Pete's Blog
•CTRL+ALT+NUMBLOCK to toggle mode on and off, there should be a beep each time you toggle
•1-9 = moving pointer around the points of the compass
•0 = right click
•enter (on keypad) = enter a menu
•backspace = back to previous menu

Troubleshooting Blue screens of Death - Wintermute21 | 2009-06-15


Debugging Tools link 

Some Common STOP codes: Bug Check 0xA: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL 

The IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x0000000A. This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.

The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen. Parameter Description 1 Memory referenced 2 IRQL at time of reference 3 0: Read 1: Write 4 Address which referenced memory Cause This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high. The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS. If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version. If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace. 


To resolve an error caused by a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS
 1. Restart your computer.
 2. Press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices.
 3. Select the Last Known Good Configuration option from the Windows Advanced Options menu. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.

To resolve an error caused by an incompatible device driver, system service, virus scanner, or backup tool
 1. Check the System Log in Event Viewer for error messages that might identify the device or driver that caused the error.
 2. Try disabling memory caching of the BIOS. 
3. Run the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
 4. Make sure the latest Service Pack is installed.
 5. If your system has small computer system interface (SCSI) adapters, contact the adapter manufacturer to obtain updated Windows drivers. Try disabling sync negotiation in the SCSI BIOS, checking the cabling and the SCSI IDs of each device, and confirming proper termination.
 6. For integrated device electronics (IDE) devices, define the onboard IDE port as Primary only. Also, check each IDE device for the proper master/subordinate/stand-alone setting. Try removing all IDE devices except for hard disks. If the message appears during an installation of Windows, make sure that the computer and all installed peripherals are listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.

Future of Artificial Intelligence in Open Source - UTOSC | 2009-06-10

Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence have enabled a basic computer system with no additional components to advance from a beginner in chess, to a master level in less than 300 games. This presentation will examine what a learning algorithm consists of, and why it may be important to Open Source in the future. By the end of this presentation the audience should have a foundational knowledge of what AI is and whether it may be useful in their own projects.

Introduction to SELinux - UTOSC | 2009-06-02

The traditional Unix security model is simple and beautiful. For decades it has been good enough for most people. However, it is starting to show its age. In the highest security settings, a more fine grained control system is needed. In the past, this meant using expensive, complicated, special purpose versions of Unix: trusted systems. (Trusted Solaris, Trusted AIX, Trusted HP-UX) SELinux, created by the NSA, is the most mature and complete response to the need for Trusted Linux systems. Unfortunately, because of the difficulty creating and maintaining trusted systems, their success has been limited. This is no longer acceptable. Today, even desktop systems and cell phones need high quality security. Imagine being able to sandbox your Web browser and e-mail client. The traditional Unix model makes this difficult and only partially possible. SELinux, on the other hand, makes fine grained security available to everyone. When it first appeared, SELinux was hard to learn and mysterious to troubleshoot. As a result, many people fear it. However, SELinux and the tools to manage it have come a long way. It's time to lay fear aside. Stuart will teach what SELinux is, why it is great, basic troubleshooting and maintenance.

The Open Source Data Center - UTOSC | 2009-05-27

During the last 10 years of system administration I have been involved in a number of data center migrations and build-outs. As these projects came and went I began to see patterns emerge in the set of services and software required to run a successful operations infrastructure. This presentation will describe these patterns, and provide an overview of the Open Source software available to implement them. About Dan: Dan Hanks has been involved with Linux System administration since 1998, when he worked for EagleNet Online, a small ISP in Provo, which, in a sense, was the birthplace of PLUG. After EagleNet he worked as a systems and database administrator for Nothsky/About.com/Primedia/United Online and is currently a system administrator for Omniture. He has varied interests, ranging from computers and technology to astronomy, geology, music, art, and family history research. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from BYU, and is the father of 4 adventuresome children. He (occasionally) blogs at http://brainshed.com, and tweets as @danhanks.

Editing the auto-generated menu in Linux - Thistleweb | 2009-04-27


Locations Menu files (requires root to edit) 
•/usr/shar/applications
Icon files •/usr/share/pixmaps
•/usr/share/icons/foo

Edit files in plain text editor like GEdit
Ellements pointed out in episode (there are plenty more, they vary per app, & distro) •Name : the name it will display on the menu (may need to change Name[foo] to reflect your language)
•Language : speaks for itself
•Comment : the rollover text
•Exec : the command it will execute when clicked
•Icon : the path to the icon shown in the menu
•OnlyShowIn : useful when trying to find why an application may not be showing the menu
•Terminal : runs the command in a terminal
•Categories : (I think) this is the submenu groups where it'll appear on the menu

Changes sometimes take a little while to update, restarting X or rebooting will force it to re-read that folder and apply the changes.
XCFE Tip •Right click to edit menu. Click on something like a separator, move it up, then down to it's original place. Save.

Parrot - UTOSC | 2009-03-24

Parrot is a virtual machine designed to efficiently compile and execute bytecode for dynamic languages. Parrot currently hosts a variety of language implementations in various stages of completion, including Tcl, Javascript, Ruby, Lua, Scheme, PHP, Python, Perl 6, APL, and a .NET bytecode translator. Parrot is not about parrots, though we are rather fond of them for obvious reasons. Guru at Guru Labs for 1.5 years. I teach, work on courseware, and assorted Perl programming. In my spare time I work on Parrot and recently a roguelike. I've been working on Parrot for about a year, in which time I've written a LOLCODE and Ruby compiler and done a lot of work on Exceptions and some work implementing features in Perl 6. I'd like to talk about Parrot and/or Perl 6! That's about as specific as I get. If nobody has any more-specific requests, I'd like to run through implementing a simple language and the parts of a Parrot compiler. Maybe scheme? I haven't decided yet.

Hacker - Thistleweb | 2009-02-02


Definitions taken from different dictionaries, with non-IT related definitions removed for relevance.

"Hacker" :n
1.A programmer who breaks into computer systems in order to steal or change or destroy information as a form of cyber-terrorism [syn: cyber-terrorist, cyberpunk]
2.A programmer for whom computing is its own reward; may enjoy the challenge of breaking into other computers but does no harm; "true hackers subscribe to a code of ethics and look down upon crackers"
3.A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.
4.One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.
5.A person capable of appreciating hack value.
6.A person who is good at programming quickly.
7.An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in `a Unix hacker'. (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.)
8.An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example.
9.One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations.
10.[deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence `password hacker', `network hacker'. The correct term for this sense is cracker.

Encryption - Xoke | 2008-12-18

Three Prime Numbers: 2, 3 and 5.
I will call them A, B and C so A=2, B=3 and C=5
Working through x as the current position, 
and i being the unencrypted password and j being the encrypted as an array,
 so i[x] is the 'current' position we get:

j[x] = ((j[x-1] + i[x] + A) * B ) MOD C

The password example I give is:

Encrypting 123

1 (unencrypted password) + 2 (Prime A) = 3
3 * 3 (Prime B) = 9
9 MOD 5 (Prime C) = 4

4 (previous encrypted) + 2 (current unencrypted) + 2 (Prime A) = 8
8 * 3 (Prime B) = 24
24 MOD 5 (Prime C) = 4

4 (previous encrypted) + 3 (current unencrypted) + 2 (Prime A) = 9
9 * 3 (Prime C) = 27
27 MOD 5 (Prime C) = 2

So the encrypted password is 442

Google App Engine 101 - UTOSC | 2008-12-17

oogle launched the App Engine service earlier this year to immense interest from the web development community. App Engine allows running applications on Google infrastructure, including BigTable, Google’s non-relational, massively scalable database. App Engine is appealing both at the low end, where small shops don’t want to have to deal with hardware procurement and systems administration, and at the high end, where the kind of “instant scaling” App Engine promises to deal with bursty traffic is the holy grail of infrastructure planning.

 Notes: 
 *.vba is a vimball file open a .vba file and follow the instructions. once in the file type :so % and hit enter to run the .vba file. that should install the vim scripts into your ~/.vim directory. it's always a good idea to run the unzip or .vba files from the directory you want to install them into, as you may come across scripts in the future that assume that's were you are. 

 default Debian/Ubuntu setting file is here: 
/usr/share/vim/vim71/debian.vim yours may be under vim70 or something else depending on your version the global /etc/vim/vimrc runs the debian.vim file 

 SnippetsEMU notes: 
 open any SOMELANGUAGE_snippets.vim file to see examples of how to setup a snippet. once snippets are installed, open a file with vim and type a snippet phrase followed by hitting the  key and the phrase should be replaced with the bits from the snippet file. 

 NERD tree notes:

 normal vim keyboard keys work in the NERD tree window. 
 :NERDTree starts it 
 q from the NERDtree window quits 
 u for up a level
 t for down a level (traverse) 
 :help NERDTree for extensive command help 

 Taglist notes: 
 normal vim keyboard keys work in the taglist window. 
 taglsits are cumulative, meaning that as you open different files in the same vim session taglist creates a new taglist tree for new files you edit. :TlistOpen starts :TlistToggle toggles between opening and closeing the taglist window F1 for help q quits/closes taglist window

Configuring Pulse Audio - klaatu | 2008-08-28


Klaatu and notJlindsay discuss Pulse Audio and how to configure it so it doesn't bork your system. One thing Klaatu fails to mention is that before you try any of this, you should just run whatever software updates may be available for your OS. Pulse configuration and compatability seems to be improving rapidly over time, so many thing may "fix themselves" by simply making sure your distro is up to date.

Circuit Bending - Morgellon | 2008-08-14

HPR Circuit Bending http://www.expertvillage.com/video-series/5058_circuit-bending-audio.htm  
 http://www.expertvillage.com/video-series/4432_circuit-bending.htm  
 Circuit bending is the creative, DIY (Do It Yourself) short-circuiting of electronic devices such as low voltage, battery-powered guitar effects, children's toys and small digital synthesizers to create new musical instruments and sound generators. Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with noise music, though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with "bent" instruments. Circuit benders remove the rear panel and connect circuits on a trial and error basis. More experienced benders use a soldering iron and add other components such as potentiometers, resistors or capacitors, which creates an even broader range of sounds.

Webkit - riddlebox | 2008-08-13

Jza, Andymeows, and riddebox have a improvised discussion about an article in the July issue of Linux Journal, called "Using Webkit In Your Desktop Application." pg 54 - 58. 
 Linux Journal = www.linuxjournal.com 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit 

 What is webkit? 
 It has a LGPL license 
 Webkit is an open source application framework that provides a foundation upon which to build a web browser. It was originally derived from the konqueror browser's khtml software library by Apple Inc. for use in Safari. You can use Designer to create a nice gui and use the classes for QtWebKit inside it. Which means that you can drag and drop forms and create the gui real fast. The best part of QtWebKit is that you can pull stuff from the internet for you applications. In the article they created an app that will download the pdf files from past issues for you. With a nice search feature for their website. 
 Examples of applications using Webkit: 
 Adium 
 Colloquy 
 MSN Messenger 
 Mac OS X's Dashboard 
 The IPhone uses it as well

What is an algorithm - Silver | 2008-07-31


What is an algorithm?

Review Question:

Try answering the follow review question by leaving a comment or answering it in your head. If you want you can even write it down on paper.

Write an algorithm for your morning routine. From the time the alarm clock rings until you leave the house for work or school.

If you're like me and do not have a job try writing an algorithm on how to write a resume.

Asus EeePC - Mubix | 2008-01-10


Mubix and Redanthrax discuss the EEpc where they discuss prices and configurations available at the time. They discuss the reliability os solidstate drives and mention that there are no moving parts.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_PC 

The Asus Eee PC is a netbook computer line from ASUSTeK Computer Incorporated, and a part of the Asus Eee product family. At the time of its introduction in late 2007, it was noted for its combination of a lightweight, Linux-based operating system, solid-state drive (SSD), and relatively low cost. Newer models added the options of Microsoft Windows operating system, rotating media hard disk drives (HDD) and initially retailed for up to 500 euro.
 The first Eee PC was a milestone in the personal computer business, launching the netbook category of small, low cost laptops in the West (in Japan, subnotebooks had long been a staple in computing). According to Asus, the name Eee derives from "the three Es", an abbreviation of its advertising slogan for the device: "Easy to learn, Easy to work, Easy to play".
 In January 2013, Asus officially ended production of their Eee PC series due to declining sales as a result of consumers favoring tablets and Ultrabooks over netbooks. However they subsequently restarted the line with the release of the 1015 series. 

They also review backtrack:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BackTrack 

BackTrack was a Linux distribution, superseded by Kali Linux, that focused on security based on the Ubuntu Linux distribution aimed at digital forensics and penetration testing use. In March 2013, the Offensive Security team rebuilt BackTrack around the Debian distribution and released it under the name Kali Linux.

Introduction to HPR - StankDawg | 2007-12-31


In this first ever show on Hacker Public Radio, StankDawg and Enigma introduce HPR. 

The story of Hacker Public Radio begins where Radio FreeK America leaves off. StankDawg was a busy with Binary Revolution Radio and so the idea lay dormant for some time. Then droops, another podcaster (Infonomicon) who was inspired by RFA got together with dosman to start TWaTech Today with a Techie, a pun on Twit. About a year in Enigma took over operations from portrello. 

Continuing on from Today with a Techie, HPR will air anything that is Of interest to hackers. Think, hacking, phone preaking, politics, survival, caffeine, linux, movie reviews, game reviews, etc. There is no restriction on the length but the shows will have the intro and outro added, which was kindly donated by slick0. Additionally there is the option to have miniseries where the hosts can have running topics to cover an issue in more detail. A mini series can also be open to so that multiple people can contribute to one topic. 

Above all HPR is a Community Network.
