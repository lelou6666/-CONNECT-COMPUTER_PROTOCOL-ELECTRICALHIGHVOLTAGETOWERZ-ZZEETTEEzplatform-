This document is a companion to Chapter 9 of the Analytical Perspectives volume of this budget, and provides the Information Technology (IT) portfolios discussed in the Budget.  For additional guidance about the formulation of the Information Technology and E-Gov Exhibit 53s for the FY2006 budget, please go to:
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a11/current_year/s53.pdf
For additional guidance about the Planning, Budgeting, Acquisition of Capital Assets,  Exhibit 300s for the FY2006 budget, please go to: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a11/current_year/s300.pdf

The document consists of two Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets:

1)      Summary.  This spreadsheet provides an overall summary of IT spending, by agency or department, for FY2004, FY2005, and FY2006.  Each agency name is hyperlinked to the section of the report providing details for the agency.  
    
2)      IT Investment Details.  This spreadsheet provides agency IT investment details in the categories of 1) Investments by Mission Area, 2) Investments for Infrastructure, Office Automation, and Telecommunications, 3) Investments for Enterprise Architecture and Planning, 4) Investments for Grants Management Systems, and 5) extramural/grants to states for some agencies.  The breakout of modernization funds versus steady state operations are displayed if reported by the agencies.  The report is in millions of dollars and some small/other projects do not breakout the modernization from the steady state so there may appear to be errors in the arithmetic.  There are comment fields for each heading describing the elements of the report.  

If you have questions about this report please contact OMB Communications at 202-395-7254.

Leviton Manuf. - Newton’s Telecom Dictionary
A
ATM Asynchronous Transfer Mode. ATM is a high band-width,
low delay, packet-like switching and multiplexing tech-nique.
Usable capacity is segmented into fixed-size cells,
consisting of header and information fields.
Attenuation The decrease in the power of a signal, light
beam, or light wave. Measured in decibels. Opposite of gain.
AWG American Wire Gauge. Standard measuring gauge for
non-ferrous conductors (i.e., non-iron and non-steel). Gauge is
a measure of the diameter of the conductor (the thickness of the
cable).
B
Backbone Wiring The physical/electrical interconnections
between telecommunications closets and equipment rooms.
Cross-connect hardware and cabling in the Main and Interme-diate
Cross-Connects are considered part of the backbone
wiring.
Bandwidth The difference between the highest and the
lowest frequencies of a transmission channel (path for infor-mation
transmission). Identifies the amount of data that can be
sent through a given channel. Measured in Hertz (Hz); higher
bandwidth numbers mean higher data capacity.
BICSI (Building Industry Consulting Service International)
Bicsi is a non-profit industry association, concerned with
promoting correct methods for all aspects of the installation of
communications wiring.
Bus A network topology in which nodes are connected to a
single cable with terminations at each end.
C
Channel The end-to-end transmission path between two
points at which application-specific equipment is connected.
CO Central Office. Telephone company facility where sub-scribers’
lines are joined to switching equipment for connection
to each other, locally and long distance. Sometimes the same
as the overseas term “public exchange”.
Coaxial Cable A cable composed of an insulated central
conducting wire wrapped in another cylindrical conductor (the
shield). The whole thing is usually wrapped in another insulat-ing
layer and an outer protective layer. A coaxial cable has
great capacity to carry vast quantities of information. It is
typically used in high-speed data and CATV applications.
Compliance A wiring device that meets all characteristics of
a standard is said to be in compliance with that standard.
Example: a data jack meeting all of the physical, electrical &
transmission standards for TIA-568A Category 5 is compliant
with that standard. See also Device and Performance.
Conductor Any substance, usually a wire or cable, that can
carry (i.e., offer a relatively small opposition to the passage of)
an electrical current.
Connecting Block Also called a terminal block, a punch-down
block, a quick-connect block, a crossconnect block. A
plastic block containing metal wiring terminals to establish
connections from one group of wires to another. Usually each
wire can be connected to several other wires in a bus or
common arrangement. There are several types of connecting
blocks: 66 clip, BIX, Krone, 110, etc. A connecting block has
insulation displacement connections (IDCs), which means you
don’t have to remove insulation from around the wire conductor
before you “punch it down” (terminate it).
Connector A device that connects wires or fibers in cable to
equipment or other wires or fibers. Wire and optical connectors
most often join transmission media to equipment or cross
connects. A connector at the end of a telephone cable or wire
is used to join that cable to another cable with a mating
connector or to some other telecommunications device.
Crossconnect Distribution system equipment used to ter-minate
and administer communication circuits. In a wire
crossconnect, jumper wires or patch cords are used to make
circuit connections. In an optical crossconnect, fiber patch
cords are used. The crossconnect is located in an equipment
room, riser closet, or satellite closet.
Crosstalk See Near-End Crosstalk.
D
Daisy Chain In telecommunications, a wiring method where
each telephone jack in a building is wired in series from the
previous jack. Daisy chain is NOT the preferred wiring method,
since a break in the wiring would disable all jacks "downstream"
from the break. See also Home Run.
dB (Decibel). A dB is a unit of measure of signal strength,
usually the relation between a transmitted signal and a stan-dard
signal source. Every 3 dB = 50% of signal strength, so
therefore a 6 dB loss = a loss of 75% of total signal strength.
Demarcation Point The point of interconnection between
telephone company facilities and your building wiring. The
demarcation point ("demarc") shall be located on the subscriber’s
side of the telephone company’s protector, or the equivalent
thereof in cases where a protector is not required.
Device As distinguished from equipment. In telecommuni-cations,
a “device” is the physical interconnection outlet. Equip-ment
(a computer, phone, fax machine, etc.) then plugs into the
device. See also Equipment and Plug.
Distribution Device A facility located within the dwelling
unit for interconnection or cross connection.
A-1.
Drop Wire Outside wire pair(s) from the telco plant (cable),
to a house or building for connection to a protector.
DTMF Acronym for Dual Tone, Multi-Frequency. See Tone Dial.
E
Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) The interference in
signal transmission or reception caused by the radiation of
electrical and magnetic fields.
Equipment As distinguished from Device. Telecommunica-tions
equipment (computers, phones, faxes, etc.) plug into the
telecommunications outlet or device. See also Device.
Ethernet A local area network used for connecting comput-ers,
printers, workstations, terminals, etc. within the same build-ing.
Ethernet operates over twisted pair wire and over coaxial
cable at speeds up to 10 Mbps. Ethernet LANs are being
promoted by DEC, Intel and Xerox. Compare with Token Ring.
FF
DDI Fiber Distributed Data Interface. FDDI is a 100 Mbps
fiber optic LAN. It is an ANSI standard. It uses a “counter-rotated”
Token ring topology. An FDDI LAN is typically known
as a “backbone” LAN. It is used for joining file servers together
and for joining other LANs together.
G
Gain The increase in signaling power that occurs as the
signal is boosted by an electronic device. Measured in
decibels (dB).
H
Headroom (also called Overhead or Margin) The number
of decibels by which a system exceeds the minimum defined
requirements. The benefit of headroom is that it reduces the
bit-error rate (BER), and provides a performance 'safety net'
to help ensure that current and future high speed applications
will run at peak accuracy, efficiency and throughput.
Home Run Phone system wiring where the individual cables
run from each phone directly back to the central switching
equipment. Home run cabling can be thought of as “star”
cabling. Every cable radiates out from the central equipment.
All PBXs and virtually all key systems work on home run cabling.
Some local area networks work on home run wiring. See also
Star Wiring, Daisy Chain.
Hub The point on a network where a bunch of circuits are
connected. Also, a switching node. In Local Area Networks, a
hub is the core of a star as in ARCNET, StarLAN, Ethernet, and
Token Ring. Hub hardware can be either active or passive.
Wiring hubs are useful for their centralized management capa-bilities
and for their ability to isolate nodes from disruption.
Hybrid Connector A connector containing both optical fiber
and electrical conductors.
I
Insulation Displacement Connection (IDC) A type of wire
A-2
termination in which the wire is “punched down” into a metal
holder which cuts into the insulation wire and makes contact
with the conductor, thus causing the electrical connection to be
made.
IDF Intermediate Distribution Frame. A metal rack designed
to connect cables and located in an equipment room or closet.
Consists of components that provide the connection between
inter-building cabling and the intra-building cabling, i.e. be-tween
the Main Distribution Frame (MDF) and individual phone
wiring. There’s usually a permanent, large cable running be-tween
the MDF and IDF. The changes in wiring are done at the
IDF. This saves confusion in wiring.
IEEE 802.3 IEEE stands for the Institute of Electrical and
Electronic Engineers, a publishing and standards-making body
responsible for many standards used in LANs, including the
802 series. Ethernet and StarLan both follow the 802.3 stan-dard.
Typically they transmit at 10 megabits per second. This
is the most common local area network specification.
Impedance The total opposition (i.e. resistance and reac-tance)
a circuit offers to the flow of alternating current. It is
measured in ohms, and the lower the ohmic value, the better the
quality of the conductor.
Interconnect 1. A circuit administration point, other than a
crossconnect or an information outlet, that provides capability for
routing and rerouting circuits. It does not use patch cords or
jumper wires, and typically is a jack-and-plug device used in
smaller distribution arrangements or that connects circuits in
large cables to those in smaller cables. 2. An Interconnect
Company is one which sells, installs, and maintains telephone
systems for end users, typically businesses.
ISDN Integrated Services Digital Network. According to AT&T,
today’s public switched phone network has many limitations;
ISDN’s vision is to overcome these deficiencies.
JJ
ack A receptacle used in conjunction with a plug to make
electrical contact between communication circuits. Jacks and
their associated plugs are used in a variety for connecting
hardware applications including cross connects, interconnects,
information outlets, and equipment connections. Jacks are used
to connect cords or lines to telephone systems. A jack is the
female component of a plug/jack connector system, and may be
standard, modified, or keyed. See also Plug and RJ.
L
LAN Local Area Network. A short distance network (typically
within a building or campus) used to link together computers
and peripheral devices (such as printers) under some form of
standard control.
Link A transmission path between two points, not including
terminal equipment, work area cables and equipment cables.
Loop 1. Typically a complete electrical circuit. 2. The loop is
also the pair of wires that winds its way from the central office
to the telephone set or system at the customer’s office, home or
factory (i.e., 'premises' in telephony terms)..
M
Mbps MegaBits Per Second. One million bits per second.
MDF Main Distribution Frame. A wiring arrangement which
connects the telephone lines coming from outside on one side
and the internal lines on the other. A main distribution frame may
also carry protective devices as well as function as a central
testing point.
MHz MegaHertz. A unit of frequency denoting one million
Hertz (i.e., 1,000,000 cycles per second).
MMJ Modified Modular Jack. A six-wire modular jack with
the locking tab shifted off to the right hand side. Used in the DEC
wiring system.
Modular Equipment is said to be modular when it is made of
“plug-in units” which can be added together to make the
system larger, improve the capabilities, or expand its size.
Multimedia Applications that communicate information by
more than one means.
N
Near-End Crosstalk (NEXT) Electrical noise coupled from
one pair of wires to another within a multi-pair cable.
Network A network ties things together. Computer networks
connect all types of computers and computer- related things—
terminals, printers, modems, door entry sensors, temperature
monitors, etc. The networks we’re most familiar with are long
distance ones, like phones and trains. Local Area Networks
(LANs) connect computer equipment within a building or campus.
O
Off-Hook When the handset is lifted from its cradle, it’s off-hook.
The term originated when the early handsets were
actually suspended from a metal hook on the phone. In modern
phones, when the handset is removed from its hook or cradle,
it completes the electrical loop, thus signaling the central office
to provide dial tone.
On-Hook When the phone handset is resting in its cradle. The
phone is not connected to any particular line. Only the bell is
active—i.e., it will ring if a call comes in. Opposite of Off-Hook.
Open (Fault) Means that the circuit is not complete or the
cable/fiber is broken.
Outlet A telecommunications outlet is a single-piece cable
termination assembly (typically on the floor or in the wall),
containing one or more modular telecom jacks. Such jacks
might be RJs, coaxial terminators, fiber optic couplers, etc. See
also Device and Equipment.
P
Part 68 Requirements Specifications established by the
FCC as the minimum acceptable protection communications
equipment must provide the telephone network.
Patching A means of connecting circuits via cords and
connectors that can be easily disconnected and reconnected
at another point. May be accomplished by using modular cords
connected between jack fields or by patch cord assemblies
that plug onto connecting blocks.
PBX Private Branch Exchange. A small, privately-owned
version of the phone company’s larger telephone central
switching office.

customer or authorized/joint user in a building(s) on continu-ous
or contiguous property (except railroad rights of way,
etc.) not separated by a public road or highway.
Premises Wiring System The entire wiring system on the
user’s premises, especially the supporting wiring that con-nects
the communications outlets to the network interface jack.
R
RBOC Regional Bell Operating Company. Seven RBOCs
exist, each of which owns two or more Bell Operating Com-panies
(BOCs). The RBOCs were carved out of the old AT&T/
Bell System during the divestiture of the Bell operating
companies from AT&T in 1984.
RCDD The RCDD (Registered Communications Distri-bution
Designer) title is a professional rating granted by
BICSI (the Building Industry Consulting Service Interna-tional).
RCDDs have demonstrated a superior level of knowl-edge
of the telecommunications wiring industry and asso-ciated
disciplines.
Return Loss A measure of the similarity of the impedance
of a transmission line and the impedance at its terminations.
It is a ratio, expressed in decibels, of the power of the
outgoing signal to the power of the signal reflected back.
Ring As in Tip and Ring. One of the two wires needed to set
up a telephone connection. See Tip.
RJ Registered Jack. RJs are telephone and data jacks/
applications registered with the FCC. Numbers, like RJ-11,
RJ-45, etc. are widely misused in the telecommunications
industry. A much more precise way to identify a jack is to
specify the number of positions (width of opening) and
number of conductors. Example: "8-position, 8-conductor
jack" or "6-position, 4-conductor jack"..
A-4
S
Series Wiring See Daisy Chain.
Service Loop When a device is terminated to the wire in
the communications outlet, a fair amount of “slack” should
be left on the wire and wound in the box to accommodate
future trimming when devices are changed out.
Splice The joining of two or more cables together by
connecting the conductors pair-to-pair.
Standards Agreed principles of protocol. Standards
are set by committees working under various trade and
international organizations.

America. A digital transmission link with a capacity of
1.544 Mbps (1,544,000 bits per second.) T1 lines are used
for connecting networks across remote distances. Bridges
and routers are used to connect LANs over T1 networks.
Talk Battery The DC voltage supplied by the central
office to the subscriber’s loop so as to allow you to have a
voice conversation.
Telco An Americanism for TELephone COmpany.

Terminate To connect a wire conductor to something,
typically a piece of equipment.
Tip 1.Ê The first wire in a pair of wires. (The second wire is
called the “ring” wire.) 2.Ê A conductor in a telephone cable
pair which is usually connected to positive side of a battery
at the telco. It is the phone industry’s equivalent of Ground
in a normal electrical circuit. See Ring.
Tone Dial A push-button telephone dial that makes a
different sound (in fact, a combination of two tones) for
each number pushed. The technically correct name for
tone dial is Dual Tone Multi Frequency, or DTMF.
Token Ring A ring topology for a local area network
(LAN) in which a supervisory frame, or token, must be
received by an attached terminal or workstation before that
terminal or workstation can start transmitting. The worksta-tion
with the token then transmits and uses the entire
bandwidth of whatever communications media the token
ring network is using.
A token ring can be wired as a circle or a star, with the
workstations wired to a central wiring center, or to multiple
wiring centers. The most common wiring scheme is called
a star-wired ring. Whatever the wiring, a token ring LAN
always works logically as a circle, with the token passing
around the circle from one workstation to another.
The advantage of token ring LANs is that media faults
(broken cable) can be fixed easily, since it’s easy to isolate
the faults. Token rings are typically installed in centralized
closets, with loops snaking to served workstations.
Topology As in network topology. The geometric physical
or electrical configuration describing a local communication
network; the shape or arrangement of a system. The most
common topologies are the bus, ring and star.
TP-PMD Twisted Pair - Physical Media Dependent.
Technology under review by the ANSI X3T9.5 working group
that allows 100 Mbps transmission over twisted-pair cable.
Twisted Pair Two insulated copper wires twisted around
each other to reduce induction (thus interference) from one
wire to the other. The twists, or lays, are varied in length to
reduce the potential for signal interference between pairs.
Several sets of twisted pair wires may be enclosed in a single
cable. In cables greater than 25 pairs, the twisted pairs are
grouped and bound together.
U
UL Underwriters Laboratories, a privately owned company
that tests to make sure that products meet safety standards.
UL also administers a program for the certification of Cat-egory-
Rated Cable.
USOC Universal Service Order Code. An old Bell system
term identifying a particular service or equipment offered
under tariff.
UTP Unshielded Twisted Pair. See Twisted Pair.
W
Workstation The working area in a building required by
one telecommunications user. Industry standards call for one
voice drop and one data drop for each workstation. The voice
drop is one 4-pair unshielded twisted pair (UTP). The data
drop may be 104-pair UTP, 152-pair shielded twisted
pair (STP), or optical fiber.
10BASE-T
An IEEE standard for operating Ethernet local area networks
(LANs) on twisted-pair cabling using the homerun method of
wiring (exactly the same as a phone system does), and a
wiring hub which will contain electronics performing similar
functions to a telephone switch.
The full name for the standard is IEEE 802.3 10Base-T. It
defines the requirement for sending information at 10 million
bits per second on ordinary unshielded twisted-pair cabling
and defines various aspects of running Ethernet on this
cabling, such as:
• Connector types (typically eight-pin RJ-45)
• Pin connections (1 and 2 for transmit, 3 and 6 for receive.
100BASE-T Provides one gigabit per second ethernet over
4 pair Category 5 cabling up to 100 meters.
1000BASE-T Provides 100 mbps per second ethernet over
2 pairs of Category 5 cabling up to 100 meters.
CATEGORY 5 APPLICATION SUMMARY
Though not an actual application, Category 5 is a structured wiring system standard which many other applications and
emerging standards require for proper operation.
The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) established standards for building cabling with the publication of the TIA/
EIA 568 Commercial Building Wiring Standard. Subsequently, the TIA issued TSB-36 and TSB-40 (Technical Service Bulletins)
which defined the category rating system as it applies to UTP cabling and connectors. Category 5 extended the characteriza-tion
of the wiring system to 100 MHz. The TIA has developed a revision of TIA/EIA-568 which incorporated the TSBs into the
main body of the standard, now called TIA/EIA-568A. Leviton QuickPort ® and InfoTap ® Category 5 products fully meet the
requirements of TIA/EIA-568A for category compliance.
Note: For a fully TIA/ EIA-568A Category 5 compliant network system, all components must be rated Category 5 and be correctly
installed to either the T568A or T568B wiring scheme with all pairs terminated.
10BASE-T (ETHERNET) APPLICATION SUMMARY
IEEE 802.3 defines the standard for 10Base-T (Ethernet) communications over unshielded twisted pair (UTP) for local area
networks as both a physical link and a data link protocol. A minimum Category 3 cabling system must be installed to insure the
proper operation of 10Base-T networks: most users now choose to upgrade their cabling infrastructure to higher levels of
performance. The physical connection described in IEEE 802.3 for network connection is an 8-position modular jack (see
diagram page C-1). Note that any system fully wired to either T568A or T568B wiring schemes will support
10Base-T applications.
TOKEN RING APPLICATION SUMMARY
IEEE 802.5 defines the Token Ring topology as a baseband network where a supervisory frame or token passes from PC to PC,
allowing each PC in turn to transmit over the entire bandwidth of the network. The most common cabling scheme is a "star-wired
ring" where each PC is connected in a star fashion to a centrally located MAU (Multistation Access Unit) which automati-cally
"heals" the ring if one PC is turned off or its cable is broken. Operating at either 4 or 16 Mbps, it is common to use
Category 3 UTP at a minimum (for 4 Mbps Token Ring); UTP rated at least Category 4 is required for 16 Mbps Token Ring, with
most owners opting to upgrade to Category 5.
ATM (ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER MODE) APPLICATION SUMMARY
ATM is a high-bandwidth, "high-speed" packet-like switching and multiplexing technique, initially proposed for data rates up to
155 Mbps and higher. Data encoding methods allow higher data bit rates at lower frequencies (e.g. 155 Mbps can run over
100Mhz rated cable.) The proposed cabling media are Category 3, Category 5 and multimode fiber. Category 5 cabling
systems are recommended as they will meet all UTP-based proposals emerging from the ATM Forum. (The ATM proposals are
being developed by a forum of over 120 application/hardware suppliers.)

Computer, Telephony & Electronics Industry Glossary
P1
It is used to denote the original Intel Pentium line of processors. See FSB.
P2
It is used to denote the Intel Pentium II line of processors.
See FSB.
P2P
This is an abbreviation for peer-to-peer, a particular type
of networking protocol.
P3
1. P3 is AOL's data transfer protocol. It is comparable to
ZMODEM. The same technology is used by other ISP s
also.
2. It is also often used to denote the Intel Pentium III line
of processors. See FSB.
P4
P4 is used to denote the new Intel Pentium IV line of
processors, due for November 2000 release . See FSB .
PABX
An acronym for Private Automatic Branch eXchange;
telephony jargon. A phone system used to switch
telephones between extensions and to outside lines. For
incoming and outgoing (dial 9) calls. Sometimes just called
PBX though a PBX system does not have to be automatic
or may not even have the capability for total automation.
packet
A unit of data sent across a network. When a large block of
data is to be sent over a network, it is broken up into
several packets, sent, and the reassembled at the other end.
Packets often include checksum codes to detect
transmission errors. The exact layout of an individual
packet is determined by the protocol and network
architecture being used. In many cases, it could be also
called a sub-unit of a data stream; a grouping of
information that includes a header (containing information
like address destination) and, in most cases, user data. This
is not to be confused with "Pack It!", a term many arrogant
programmers have heard from many supervisors over the
years.
packet reflection
This error message is received when a packet of data could
not be transmitted properly and was sent back (reflected) to
the origin. This is a network based error.
packet sniffing
The intentional and usually illegal act of intercepting
packets of data being transmitted over the Internet and
searching them for information. This can be done without
the sender's or recipient's knowledge. It is the equivalent of
line-tapping.
packet switched network or PSN
A network sub-architecture that does not establish a
dedicated path through the network for the duration of a
session, opting instead to transmit data in units called
packets in a connectionless manner; data streams are
broken into packets at the front end of a transmission, sent
over the best available network connection of possibly
many, and then reassembled in their original order at the
destination endpoint.
packet switching
A switching system that uses a physical communications
connection only long enough to transit a data message; data
messages are disassembled into packets and reassembled at
the receiving end of the communication link; packets may
travel over many diverse communications links to get to
the common endpoint. This is most often contrasted with
circuit switching in data communications, where all data
messages transmitted during a session are transmitted over
the same path for the duration of the session.
pad
1. A specially surfaced material to allow the users of mice,
a place to optimize operation.
2. A graphics tablet for data input into programs such as
CAD/CAM . They are often mouse-like in function but
stationary with a pointer that moves over them
stationary with a pointer that moves over them.
3. An acronym for Packet Assembler/Disassembler. The
hardware device used to connect simple devices (like
character mode terminals) that do not support the full
functionality of a particular protocol to a network. PADs
buffer data and assemble and disassemble packets sent to
such end devices.
4. A digitizer.
5. A place where many nerdy type programmers lived in
the '60s.
pad character
1. A character used to fill empty space. (In some cases, it
could be considered "education"...) Many applications
have fields that must be a particular length. For example, in
a database application, you may have a field that is ten
characters in length. If you use only four of the allotted
characters, the program itself must fill in the remaining six
characters with pad characters. Some applications allow
you to choose the character to be used as padding. Most
padding by default is done with a space character, as issued
by the space bar.
2. A "home body" from the 1960's.
pagination
The process, in most word processors, of calculating the
properties of a page in order to assign page breaks.
PAL

Palmtop
Palmtops are a class of portable personal computers
(generally with PDA software) that fit in the palm of your
hand. One of the most well-known palmtops is the Pilot,
developed by PalmOS and marketed originally by US
Robotics, now 3COM.
Panasonic
A leading manufacturer and supplier in all commercial
electronics industries worldwide. They have several
International manufacturing and operations locations. See
them at HTTP://WWW.PANASONIC.COM .
Paper Mail
Some E-Mail services offer this service so that you can
send Internet E-Mail to people who don't even own
computers. A form of snail-mail. A loose reference to the
US Mail service. See mail.
parallel
1. A form of data transfer and communications, most often
used with printers. It is the opposite of and an alternative to
serial communications. Printers and other devices are said
to be either parallel or serial. Parallel means the device is
capable of receiving more than one bit at a time (that is, it
receives several bits in parallel). Most modern printers are
parallel or USB.
2. A type of bus connection, transferring data in a similar
means as a parallel printer connection.
3. In electronics, two components can be connected
together in two different ways, series and parallel. Each
component has two different ends or poles. They can be
positive and negative but may not be. For identification,
they are known as Alpha and Beta. While the nomenclature
is not exactly original, it serves the purpose. If similar
components, such as a resistor and another resistor, or a
capacitor and another capacitor, are in parallel in a circuit,
the alpha pole of one is connected to the alpha pole of the
other, directly, while the beta pole and other beta pole also
connect directly. See our Parallel Resistance Calculator
and our Parallel Capacitance Calculator to resolve
values for either resistance or capacitance.
parameter
A guideline or limitation of software or process functions.
In the case of search software, parameters are Boolean
factors, the words or letters you are trying to find, where
you want the search to include in the looking process and
the like.
Parental Control
Parental Control is an ISP feature that allows a parent to
restrict a child's access to certain areas of ISP provided
services and the Ineternet . Such control is also available
in most modern browsers and is available as a separate
application . While it is not foolproof, it is a good thing.
There are also some standards being set on the web. See
Net Nanny , Safe For Kids , CyberAngels , SafeSurf or
Recreational Software Advisory Council for more
information. These are certainly not all involved but a
representative group. This site CSGNETWORK.COM, is
rated for users of all age groups and is devoted to keeping
unfit material off the Internet, at least filtering it.
parity
A method of data integrity checking that adds a single bit
to each byte of data. The parity bit is responsible for
checking for errors in the other 8 bits (or less, depending
on the arrangement). Parity is logic that detects the
presence of an error in memory. Generally, a single parity
bit is used for each byte (8 bits) of data. The most
commonly used forms of parity are even parity odd parity
commonly used forms of parity are even parity, odd parity,
and checksums.
parse
To search through a stream of text and either break it up
into useful chunks of information or reformat it in some
other manner.
partition
1. A portion or a segment of memory or storage memory,
such as a hard disk. Most commonly used as a section of a
hard drive. Hence the name partition. When you format a
hard drive, you can assign the number of partitions you
want on a physical hard disk. The computer will recognize
each partition as a separate drive, and they will show up as
different drives under most operating systems; a logical
drive.
2. The act of creating a logical drive.
3. To break into smaller sections, such as a hard drive.
Most often, smaller but multiple partitions can improve the
efficiency of your hard drive. On larger drives, the cluster,
or block sizes (the minimum amount of space a file can
take up), are also very large, which can result in a waste of
disk space. So multiple partitions can actually give you
more space.
4. Partitioning can also be used to allow multiple operating
systems on the same drive of a given computer. Most of the
32bit file structures do not allow that but earlier OS
software, such as Windows 85, 98 (original), OS2, DOS
and early NT did.
5. A form of computer office and work area segregation so
that hardware people can be isolated from software people.
PASC Mail
An acronym for Portable Applications Standards
Committee; a group within the IEEE. PASC is the group
that has and continues to develop the POSIX family of
standards. See them at HTTP://WWW.PASC.ORG .
password
Your password is like a key to your home. It is one of the
primary forms of online security. It is needed for you to get
online, and to change your billing information. A different
password is often needed for applications that are online.
NEVER GIVE YOUR PASSWORD(s) TO ANYONE.
Most ISP's staff will NEVER ask you for your password. If
someone does ask for that password, challenge them as to
who they really are.
password surfing
Like any large community, all ISP services have their share
of undesirable characters. On most services, they make
themselves known by masquerading as ISP employees
Frequently they will send a new member an instant
message or E-Mail claiming that the system has lost their
information, or offering them free service for a year. This is
called password surfing. These people are NOT ISP
employees, and they are trying to steal from you. To
protect yourself, NEVER give your password or billing
information to anyone. Most ISP employees will never ask
you for your password or billing information.
path
The hierarchical description of where a directory, folder, or
file is located on your computer or on a network.
payload
A telephony term that describes the portion of a frame or
cell that carries user traffic. It is effectively what remains in
the frame or cell if you take out all headers or trailers.
PBX
1. A telephony acronym denoting Private Branch
Exchange, a physical private telephone network.
2. A small telephone switching system (exchange) usually
on a customer's premises that also connects to the public
switched telephone network. See PABX.
PC
See personal computer.
PC100
In roughly the middle of 1998, Intel introduced the BX
chip set to their motherboard designs. One element in this
new architecture included an increase in the PC main
memory bus speed (Host bus) from 66 to 100 MHz, called
PC100. To match the 100MHz bus speed, 100MHz
SDRAM modules are used. These modules are often
referred to as PC100 compliant. See personal computer
(PC).
PCAV
An acronym for Partial Constant Angular Velocity. See
(CAV) and (CLV).
PC133
A further extension of the PC100 specification, the PC133
specification details the requirements for SDRAM used on
133MHz FSB motherboards. PC133 SDRAM can be used
on 100MHz FSB motherboards but will not yield a
performance advantage over PC100 memory at 100MHz.
See personal computer.
PCB
A component made up of layers of copper and fiberglass;
the surface of a PCB features a pattern of copper lines, or
"traces," that provide electrical connections for chips and
other components that mount on the surface of the PCB. A
term used in the electronics industry to denote a RAW
(non-populated) Printed Circuit Board. Once components
are populated on it, the board is sometimes called a card.
See motherboard, systemboard or mainboard .
PC Card
The current and newest name for PCMCIA.
PCDOS
The sometimes used name for PCOS.
PCI
Acronym for Peripheral Component Interconnect, a local
bus computer standard developed by Intel Corporation.
Most modern PCs include a bus that is only PCI capable;
early PCI designs incorporated the PCI bus in addition to a
more general ISA expansion bus. Those are now called
Legacy capable motherboards. Many analysts, however,
believe that PCI will eventually supplant ISA entirely; it
appears that non ISA systems are now the norm rather than
the exception in the year 2000. PCI is also used on newer
versions of the Macintosh computer. PCI is a 64-bit bus,
though it is usually implemented as a 32-bit bus. It can run
at clock speeds of 33 or 66 MHz. At 32 bits and 33 MHz, it
yields a throughput rate of 133 MBps. Board pin density is
also greater and for confusion avoidance, boards will not
interchange in ISA and PCI slots. Although it was
developed by Intel, PCI is not tied to any particular family
of microprocessors.
PCL
The acronym for Printer Control Language, a product of
HP. This was originally designed by HP for the LaserJet+.
It is now the base, in revision 5, of all of the printers in the
HP line. It is an interpreted language, similar to but more
intelligent than PostScript.
PCM
A telephony term describing a particular type of
modulation, Pulse Code Modulation.
PCMCIA
An acronym meaning Personal Computer Memory Card
Industry Association. A standard that allows
interchangeability of various computing components on the
same connector. The PCMCIA standard is designed to
support input/output (I/O) devices, including memory,
Fax/modem, SCSI, and networking products. Many laptop
computers use these devices as modems or network
interfaces. It is an organization consisting of some 500
companies that has developed a standard for small, credit
card-sized devices, called PC Cards. Originally designed
for adding memory to portable computers, the somewhat
loose PCMCIA standard has been expanded several times
and is now suitable for many types of devices. There are in
fact three types of PCMCIA cards. All three have the same
rectangular size (85.6 by 54 millimeters), but different
widths:
Type I cards can be up to 3.3 mm thick, and are used
primarily for adding additional ROM or RAM to a
computer.
Type II cards can be up to 5.5 mm thick. These cards are
often used for NIC, modem and fax modem cards.
Type III cards can be up to 10.5 mm thick, which is
sufficiently large for portable disk drives.
As with the cards, PCMCIA slots also come in three sizes:
A Type I slot can hold one Type I card
A Type II slot can hold one Type II card or two Type I
cards
A Type III slot can hold one Type III card or a Type I and
Type II card.
A full house beats three of a kind! So much for the details.
In general, though there are always exceptions, you can
exchange PCMCIA Cards on the fly, without rebooting
your computer. For example, you can slip in a Fax modem
card when you want to send a fax and then, when you're
done, replace the Fax modem card with a memory card.
You can also fit (and use) smaller cards into larger slots
but not the reverse. They are currently (as of mid-1999)
just known as PC Cards.
P-Code
See microcode.
PCOS
Personal Computer (IBM PC) Operating System, a coined
shorthand name for the DOS only software from several
companies running a low level platform on compatibles.
This was originally the name, though also known as
PCDOS, given to IBM's version of the first IBM produced
operating for PCs. They soon gave way to Microsoft
produced DOS. They have made several other efforts at PC
operating systems but have not been able to produce one
that was competitive to Microsoft.
PCS
A telephony term describing wireless communications
technology that operates at 1900 MHz. A loosely defined
future ubiquitous telecommunication service that will
allow "anytime, anywhere" voice and data communication
with personal communication with personal
communications devices.
PDA
1. An acronym for Personal Digital Assistant. A small,
totally portable device that combines computing,
telephone/fax, and networking features. A typical PDA can
function as a cellular phone, Fax sender, and personal
organizer. Unlike portable computers, most PDAs use a
pen-like stylus rather than a keyboard for input. This means
that they also feature handwriting recognition. Some PDAs
also make use of voice recognition technologies. Apple
Computer pioneered the field of PDA by introducing the
Newton MessagePad in 1993. Shortly thereafter, several
other manufacturers offered similar products. To date,
PDAs have had only modest success in the marketplace,
due to their high price tags and limited applications.
However, many experts believe that PDAs will eventually
become common gadgets.
2. PDA is a term for any small mobile hand-held device
that provides computing and information storage and
retrieval capabilities for personal or business use, often for
keeping schedule calendars and address book information
handy. Most PDAs have a small keyboard. Some PDAs
have an electronically sensitive pad on which handwriting
can be received. Some PDAs offer a variation of the
Microsoft Windows operating system called Windows CE.
Other products have their own or another operating system.
pdf files
Adobe's Portable Document Format (pdf) is a translation
format used primarily for distributing files, such as
documentation, across a network, or on a web site. This is
an inexpensive way for CD distributors to include
documentation with a CD based program or suite of
programs. Files with a .pdf extension have been created in
another application and then translated into .pdf files so
they can be viewed by anyone, regardless of platform. The
Adobe Acrobat PDF Reader software is necessary to view
these files, and can be obtained free at many sites, provided
by Adobe, or get it here, Acrobat PDF Reader central .
Adobe can be accessed through HTTP://WWW.ADOBE.COM.
peer-to-peer
A simple, small type of network in which each
workstation has the ability for equivalent capabilities and
responsibilities. Each station can be a server and each can
be a client at the same time. This differs from client/server
architectures, in which some computers are dedicated to
serving the others. Peer-to-peer networks are generally
simpler and less expensive, but they usually do not offer
the same performance under heavy loads. In fact, they are a
compromise at best in either way they are used. But they
are efficient with high enough horsepower hardware and
with a good network integrated operating system. A major
player in the early LAN days, offering this type technology,
was Artisoft's LANtastic. Currently, all Windows operating
systems of 95 and up offer this technology built in. It is just
referred to as the Microsoft network.
Peer Web Services
See PWS.
Pentium
One of Intel's family of microprocessors; introduced in
1993. A class of microprocessor made by Intel. The series
has come from the early Pentium 60 Mhz, bus speeds of 66
Mhz and a 64kb cache, to the Pentium II (1997) series
which began at 233 Mhz to 450 Mhz with bus speeds of
100 Mhz and a L2 chache of 512kb with full speed
capability, to the current Pentium III series (1999), from
450 Mhz well into the Ghz speed, 133 Mhz bus with a
512kb to 2mb L2 cache with full speed capability. (As of
August 2000, a 1.5 Ghz Pentium IV has been announced
for November release. Early chips have been problematic.)
There has also been a Pentium Pro (1995) with speeds in
the 166 Mhz to 266 Mhz range, and Pentium XEON
(1998) to add to the group; a revised XEON version was
made in 1999 in Pentium III configuration with speeds in
the 800+ Mhz range. There have been low power versions
for laptops. In 1999, a lower performance version was
released, called the Celeron; it was designed to lower the
overall cost of computers that did not need ultra high
performance. The Celeron has a slower bus, smaller cache
and less efficient (slower) decision making path. The
Pentium series CPUs were designed to run Windows but
will obviously run other OS software as well. See FSB.
people connection
The People Connection, or similar name, is most ISP 's
main chatting forum. There are always hundreds or
thousands of people chatting about something.
Perl
A programming language whose acronym stands for
"Practical Extraction and Report Language". Perl is a
powerful, yet unstructured language that is especially good
for writing quick and dirty programs that process text files.
Because of these abilities, Perl is a common choice of
programmers for writing CGI scripts to automate input and
output from web pages. Perl was invented in 1986 by Larry
Wall and is available to anyone at no charge. The library is
now Perl5.
Here is the Perl version of "Hello World!":
print "Hello World\n";
permanent virtual circuit or PVC
1. A PVC is a permanent channel connection between two
ATM devices. PVC’s allow network transmissions to be
started without having to first establish a connection with
the end point ATM device. When a PVC is constructed, the
end points of the connection will agree upon a path in
which data will travel, and therefore agree upon the route
that data will travel to reach its destination.
2. A type of conduit pipe made of plastic used to tunnel or
route network and phone cables in some installations.
personal computer - PC
The original personal computer model introduced by IBM
in 1981. Because IBM was late to enter the desktop
computer field, it created the PC with an "open
architecture" so that it could compete with the then popular
Apple II computers. This open architecture meant that any
computer manufacturer could legally manufacture
PC-compatible machines that could run the same software
as IBM's PC. Since IBM purchased its CPU chips from
Intel and its operating system (DOS) from Microsoft,
makers of PC-compatibles (called clones at the time) were
able to utilize the same chips and OS as IBM. As a result,
PCs became the most popular home computer, IBM's
fortunes dropped, and Microsoft and Intel became the
multi-million dollar companies that they are today. Current
popular usage of the term PC refers to both IBM produced
personal computers and PC-compatible computers
produced by other manufacturers.
Personal Preferences
Personal choices and preferences is your ISP 's online
preference utility. All services have some such device.
With it you can change your multimedia preferences or
change your screen names, as well as other things. What
you select is what you get!
Personal Filing Cabinet or PFC
Your ISP's file organization tool, through your browser or
service.
Personal Finance & Management
A channel of most ISP online services that is dedicated to
your money, helping you to keep it and making it grow.
Personal Web Server
See PWS.
petabyte
A number that is the literal equivalent of 2 to the 50th
power (1,125,899,906,842,624) bytes; it is a quadrillion in
the American system. A petabyte is equal to 1,024
terabytes. It is a noun and not an action (it has nothing to
do with pets that bite). Don't know your KB from your
MB? Try our memory and storage converter. (Also see
powers of ten , kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, exabyte,
zettabyte and yottabyte.)
PGP
See Pretty Good Privacy.
Philips
A leading manufacturer and supplier in all commercial
electronics industries worldwide. They have several
International manufacturing and operations locations. See
them at HTTP://WWW.PHILIPS.COM.
Phish
Trying to illegally obtain someone's password by false
representations. Frequently, "phishers" will send instant
messages or E-Mail to new members claiming that they are
ISP employees and need the password because of a system
problem. GENERALLY, NO ISP STAFF MEMBER WILL
EVER ASK FOR YOU PASSWORD. If you are asked for
your password, the person asking you is not an ISP staff
member, and they should be reported or ignored.
Phoenix
The industry name for Phoenix Technologies, an industry
pioneer and giant in the BIOS business for computers,
hand held devices and phones. See them at
HTTP://WWW.PHOENIX.COM.
PHP
Personal Home Page is a server-side ( SSI ), HTML
embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web
pages. In an HTML document, PHP script (similar syntax
to that off Perl or C ) is enclosed within special PHP tags.
Because PHP is embedded within tags, the author can jump
between HTML and PHP (similar to ASP and Cold Fusion)
instead of having to rely on heavy amounts of code to
output HTML. And, because PHP is executed on the
server, the client cannot view the PHP code. PHP can
perform any task any CGI program can do, but its strength
lies in its compatibility with many types of databases. Also,
PHP can talk across networks using IMAP, SNMP, NNTP,
POP3, or HTTP. PHP was created sometime in 1994 by
Rasmus Lerdorf. During mid 1997, PHP development
entered the hands of other contributers. Two of them, Zeev
Suraski and Andi Gutmans, rewrote the parser from scratch
to create PHP version 3 (PHP3). Today, PHP is shipped
standard with a number of Web servers, including RedHat
Linux.
physical layer
Layer 1 of the OSI reference model. The physical layer
defines the electrical, mechanical, procedural, and
functional specifications for activating, maintaining, and
deactivating the physical link between end systems.
Corresponds with the physical control layer in the SNA
model.
pico
A metric prefix that denotes the equivalent of one
trillionth, 10 to the -12th power, in the American system.
See the inverse represented by terabyte.
picosecond
A measurement of time . There are 1,000,000,000,000 (a
trillion) picoseconds in a second. For more information on
both common and uncommon timely tidbits, see our
displays of time and time zone conversions on our listing
of various converters and calculators.
Picture Studio
Picture Studio is a place where you can learn about chat
events, search for pictures of your favorite chat partners, or
catch up on the latest hot community news. Most ISP
services provide such a service under various names.
PINE
Acronym for Program for Internet News and E-Mail, a
character-based E-Mail client for UNIX systems.
Developed at the University of Washington, PINE replaces
an older E-Mail program called elm. They were somewhat
similar but not exactly the same. Both are somewhat
antiquated now.
PING
1. Abbreviation for Packet InterNet Groper. A connection
testing program that sends a self-returning packet to a host
and times how long it takes to return.
2. Great golf clubs.
PIO
1. Acronym for Programmed Input/Output, a method of
transferring data between two devices that uses the
computer's main processor as part of the data path. ATA
uses PIO and defines the speed of the data transfer in terms
of the PIO mode implemented, as shown in the information
below:
PIO Mode, Data Transfer Rate (MBps), Standard
0 3.3 ATA
1 5.2 ATA
2 8.3 ATA
3 11.1 ATA-2
4 16.6 ATA-2
ATA-3, ATA/33 and ATA/66 do not have a PIO mode
assignment as of yet, although ATA-3 is often used in
PIO4 since it is really a correction to ATA-2.
pipeline
In DRAMs and SRAMs, a method for increasing the
performance using multistage circuitry to stack or save data
while new data is being accessed. The depth of a pipeline
varies from product to product. For example, in an EDO
DRAM, one bit of data appears on the output while the
next bit is being accessed. In some SRAMs, pipelines may
contain bits of data or more.
pixel
A pixel is the smallest unit of space on a computer screen.
Each little dot is a pixel. Resolution is a measure of how
many pixels you can fit on your screen. The greater the
resolution, the smaller the images but the more you see on
the screen at one time. The greater the resolution, the
longer the screen refresh time and the slower the overall
operation. 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768 are the most
common. Resolution and numbers of colors available are
determine by your computer's video card capability. More
often than not, the larger the number of colors, the slower
the operation. Most Internet operations are limited to 256
colors; numbers set for greater than that do not usually
help. Older equipment may only support 16 colors.
PKUnzip
PKUnzip is a standard DOS decompression utility used to
extract files from .ZIP archives. There are also Windows
versions of this architecture; not all are from the original
PK company. PKZip is the compression utility. The
resulting files are called .ZIP files.
The initials PK are from the company and architecture
founder, Phil Katz. Phil was a friend of mine and a
business associate. We often discussed the viability of the
compression technology in the early 1980s. He felt is
would be big; I didn't but we still were close in sharing
technology. Phil passed away in April of 2000. He is
missed already, especially by me. The PK company is at
HTTP://WWW.PKWARE.COM.

PLA
An acronym for Programmable Logic Array, a chip (IC)
based programmed logical program. PLAs are members of
a broad category of chips called PLDs.
platform
1. A platform is a version of interface software meant for a
specific computer. Examples of such software are for the
DOS, Windows, Windows95, AS400, Data General, Unix,
DEC, Magic Link, Casio Zoomer, and Macintosh
platforms. there are many more. Many ISPs only support
two or three platforms; some only one.
2. Something that short programmers put chairs on so that
they can reach the keyboard on top of the desk.
PLD
An acronym for Programmable Logic Device. While often
just called a logic chip, it is an integrated circuit (IC) that
can be programmed, with proper equipment, to perform
complex functions. A PLD consists of arrays of internal
AND and OR gates (see Boolean ). A system designer
implements a logic design with a device programmer that
blows fuses on the PLD to control gate operation. The
logic is based on which gates are open and which gates are
closed. System designers generally use development
software that converts basic code into programmatic
instructions a device programmer needs to create a design
and put it into operation. PLD types can classified into
three groups, PROMs, PALs or GALs and PLAs, and two
classifications, Simple PLDs (SPLD) and Complex PLDs,
(CPLD).
plug-and-play or PnP
Plug and Play is at best a hopeful name. Long time industry
people renamed the term to Plug and Pray. (it seems there
were many clergy involved in the original development.)
PnP is the acronym (there is always an acronym...) that also
has a counterpart, TnT, indicating how unstable the early
PnP cards really were. Since R2 of W95, things have been
better. W2000 is supposed to really have a grip of sorts on
PnP with an entire section of System devoted to it. The
theory is that OS and card, working together, have the
ability within a computer system to automatically configure
expansion boards and other devices. You should be able to
plug in a device and play with it, without worrying about
setting DIP switches, jumpers, and other configuration
elements. Since the introduction of the NuBus, the Apple
Macintosh has been a plug-and-play computer. The players
involved and the varied options are limited by Apple's
resistance to sharing technology. The Plug and Play (PnP)
specification has made PCs more plug-and-play, although
it doesn't always work as advertised.
plug-in
Plug-ins are software programs that extend the usability of
a program you are using, most often browsers. There are
plug-ins for playing real time audio clips, video clips,
animation, and more. Internet plug-ins work with your ISP
service or with your browser. Here is a source of them
from Browser Watch.
PNP
See plug-and-play.
Point of Presence - POP
A site that has a collection of telecommunications
equipment, usually refers to ISP or telephone company
sites. This is not to be confused with POP3, a particular
mail server technology supporting Post Office Protocol.
Point To Point Connection
A data network circuit with one control and one tributary.
Also see PPP.
Point to Point Protocol
See PPP.
PONS
PONS is an acronym for Passive Optical Network. This is a
high bandwidth point to multipoint optical fiber network
based on the asynchronous transfer mode protocol, (ATM).
PONs generally consist of an OLT (Optical Line
Termination), which is connected to ONUs (Optical
Network Units), more commonly known as subscriber
terminals, using only fiber cables, optical splitters and
other passive components (do not transmit signals using
electricity). At present, a maximum 32 ONUs can be
connected to any one OLT but OLTs can be cascaded. The
OLT is located at a local exchange (CO), and the ONU is
located either on the street, in a building, or even in a user's
home. PONs rely on lightwaves instead of copper wire for
data transfer. In a PON, signals are routed over the local
link with all signals along that link going to all interim
transfer points. Optical splitters route signals through the
network; optical receivers at intermediate points and
subscriber terminals tuned for specific wavelengths of light
direct signals intended for their groups of subscribers. At
the final destination, a specific residence or business can
detect its own and only its own, specified signal. PONs are
capable of delivering high volumes of upstream and
downstream bandwidth (up to 622 Mbps downstream and
155 Mbps upstream), which can be changed "on-the-fly"
depending on an individual user's needs. This type of
tuning of the bandwidth is a technology that will be very
popular in the near future.
POP
See Point of Presence . Also a protocol used for E-Mail
functions, now in the 2nd revision, POP3. Most E-Mail
applications (sometimes called an E-Mail client) use the
POP protocol, although some can use the newer IMAP
(Internet Message Access Protocol). There are two versions
of POP. The first, called POP2 (why did it start with a 2?
Why ask why?), became a standard in the mid-80's and
requires SMTP to send messages. The newer version,
POP3, can be used with or without SMTP. Most ISPs still
use SMTP for transmission and only a few do NOT use
POP3.
port
1. A physical address on a computer or computer device.
This may often be associated with a mapped mapped
memory location to allow certain types of connections or
may also be associated with a physical connecting device.
This is often used in conjunction with Input/Output
devices.
2. A location we all look for in a storm; any will do!
3. A programming beverage for sophisticated
programmers, usually enjoyed with cheese and crackers;
most veteran (real!) programmers drink Pepsi and have
moon pies.
portable
1. A term used to describe hardware that is small and
lightweight, and can be battery powered for at least an
hour. A portable computer is a computer small enough to
carry. Portable computers include, ranging from largest to
smallest, laptops, notebook and subnotebook computers,
hand-held computers, palmtops, and PDAs.
2. An ambiguous term used to describe software has the
ability to run on a variety of computers. Portable and
machine independent mean the same thing; the software
does not depend on a particular type of hardware. Java is a
language that creates such software although there are
other languages that do the same thing. The software may
require compiling for a platform but the native code is the
same.
portal
A Web site or service that offers a broad array of resources
and services, most of which, but not all, are on-line, such
as e-mail, forums, search engines, and on-line shopping
malls. The first Web portals were online services, such as
AOL and Compuserve, that provided access to the Web,
but by now most of the traditional search engines have
transformed themselves into Web portals to attract and
keep a larger audience. Typically, this sort of service also
yields the user a central place to find what he needs. See
vortal.
portfolios
Portfolios are an ISP feature that allows you to keep track
of your stocks.
POS
An acronym for Point Of Sale. POS is both the time and
place in which a transaction is made and it describes a
special terminal used in computerized accounting systems.
POS computer systems include cash registers, optical
scanners, BAR code equipment, special printers, magnetic
card readers, and special monitors or terminals. Reading
merchandise tags, updating inventory, checking credit and
directly or indirectly interfacing with an accounting system
are some of the operations performed by the point of sale
system.
POSIX
An acronym for Portable Operating System Interface for
UNIX, a group of IEEE and ISO standards that more or
less define an interface between programs and hypothetical
operating systems. (This has nothing to do with portable
devices.) By designing their programs to conform to
POSIX standards and requirements, software developers
have some degree of assurance that their software can be
easily ported to POSIX compliant operating systems, now
and in the future. At present, this includes most flavors and
offerings of UNIX as well as Windows NT. The standard is
loose at the moment but will be more stringent in the
future. The POSIX standards are now maintained by a
division of the IEEE called the Portable Applications
Standards Committee ( PASC). Considering the impact of
portability of operating systems, this may well be an
important factor in the future of computing.
post
1. To send a message to a public area like a BBS or
newsgroup where it can be read by many others.
2. A programmer's work area; Man your post!
Post Master
The name given to the person in charge of dealing with
E-Mail for a particular site. In the case of mail, it is
postmaster (all one word, lower case). According to
convention, mail sent to postmaster@your.com should be
read by a real live person, if you have one.
Post Office
The ISP post office is an area that helps new members
acclimate themselves to the world of E-Mail . There are
many forms of E-Mail and the exact protocol is different
from one ISP to another.
POTS
Short for plain old telephone service, which refers to the
standard telephone service that most homes use. In
contrast, telephone services based on high-speed, digital
communications lines, such as ISDN and FDDI, are not
POTS. The main distinctions between POTS and
non-POTS services are speed and bandwidth . POTS is
generally restricted to about 52 Kbps (52,000 bits per
second). The POTS network is also called the public
switched telephone network (PSTN).
POTS splitter
A frequency splitting device used on standard POTS lines
to invoke operations involved with others services, such as
DSL operations. In the case of ADSL, the splitter divides
the total bandwidth of the line into three channels, one for
fairly high speed downloading, one for medium speed
uploading and one for standard voice. All can take place on
the same standard dialup line at the same time. Each uses a
different frequency.
power newbie
An enthusiastic newbie (network newcomer) who takes
advantage of educational resources in an effort to become a
knowbie. Power newbies share their knowledge with other
newbies both face-to-face and in bulletin boards and chat
rooms. See also newbie and knowbie.
powers of ten
We offer a wonderful page we found at Cal Tech as an
understandable source of information on the powers of ten
as related to data. See it here! . (Also see kilobyte ,
megabyte , gigabyte , terabyte , exabyte , petabyte ,
zettaabyte and yottabyte.)
PowerQuest
PowerQuest Corporation, by self-definition, is a leading
software developer and technology pioneer, providing
solutions to simplify complex storage management issues.
We think that is modest. We define them as producing
some of the best software available to do things with disk
drives that DOS, Windows, Novell and Linux can probably
do, but take much longer, in many more steps and have far
less acceptable results. We have found that our business
cannot get along without them. See them at
WWW.POWERQUEST.COM.
power supply
1. The component that supplies power to a computer or
other electrical device. Most personal computers can be
plugged into standard electrical outlets. The power supply
then pulls the required amount of electricity and converts
the AC current to DC current. It also regulates the voltage
to eliminate voltage or current spikes and surges common
in most electrical systems. Not all power supplies,
however, do an adequate voltage-regulation job, so a
computer is always susceptible to large voltage
fluctuations. Power supplies are rated in terms of the
number of watts they generate. The more powerful the
computer, the more watts it can provide to components. In
general, 200 watts should be sufficient. See UPS .
2. The term given to an electrical generator, used where
power is not available always or at all.
PPP
Point to Point Protocol, one of two standard methods of
connecting to the Internet. With a PPP account, you can
connect to some generally direct connect services over the
Internet . As the name implies, it is a protocol .
PPTP
An acronym for Point to Point Tunneling Protocol, a new
technology for creating Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) ,
developed jointly by Microsoft Corporation, U.S. Robotics
(now 3COM), and several remote access vendor
companies, known collectively as the PPTP Forum. A
VPN is a private network of computers that uses the public
Internet to connect some nodes. Because the Internet is
essentially an open network, the Point to Point Tunneling
Protocol (PPTP) is used to ensure that messages
transmitted from one VPN node to another are secure.
With PPTP, users can dial in to their corporate network via
the Internet. Although PPTP has been submitted to the
IETF for standardization, it is currently available only on
networks served by a Windows NT 4.0 server and Linux.
See L2F and L2TP , two competing but similar
technologies.
PQ
An acronym for Priority Queuing. It is the assignment of
order of operation.
precharge
1. On a DRAM, the amount of time required between a
control signal's (such as RAS) transition to an inactive state
and its next transition to an active state.
2. With your children, it is a time before you allow them to
use your credit cards. The skill of charging is usually
taught by the wife in the family.
Preferences
An ISP software feature that allows you to customize such
features as sound and text size. A group of options
controlled by you.
presentation layer
Layer 6 of the OSI reference model. This layer ensures that
information sent by the application layer of one system will
be readable by the application layer of another. The
presentation layer is also concerned with the data structures
used by programs and therefore negotiates data transfer
syntax for the application layer. Corresponds roughly with
the presentation services layer of the SNA model. See also
application layer, LLC, MAC, network layer, physical
layer , PQ , session layer , and transport layer .
Pretty Good Privacy - PGP
A program, developed by Phil Zimmerman, that uses
cryptography to protect files and electronic mail from being
read by others. PGP also includes a feature which allows
users to digitally "sign" a document or message, in order to
provide non-forgeable proof of authorship. New
technology is under consideration by the government to
allow such actions to be legal and binding.
PRI
An acronym for Primary Rate Interface, an ISDN service
providing users with 23 64 kbps bearer (or B) channels for
message information and 1 64 kbps data (or D) channel for
signaling and control over an existing telephone line. This
service has been antiquated with the advent of DSL
variations.
primary memory
See RAM and secondary memory.
print
1. If you have a printer connected to your computer, you
can use the PRINT option under the FILE menu to print
text and some pictures.
2. The fine stuff you didn't bother to read when you signed
up for 50 years of Internet service at $50 a month because
you thought it was a great deal!
Prodigy
A commercial online ISP and Internet service.
program
A series of instructions that tell a computer what to do.
Also, as a verb, to create or revise a program. See
programmer.
programmer
1. An individual who creates or revises a program on any
sort of device that responds to structured instructions as the
control for operations. 2. A device that places instructions
into a PROM , ROMROM or other chip for use in a
computerized device.
programming language
A computer language that programmers utilize to create
programs. C, Perl, Java, BASIC, and COBOL are examples
of programming languages. In essence, programming
languages are translators that take words and symbols and
convert them to binary codes that the CPU can understand.
See also Ada, APL, AppleScript, assembly language, awk,
C++, CODASYL, cxml, Delphi, Eiffel, FORTRAN,
GW-BASIC, MBASIC, NetBASIC, MuBASIC, JavaScript,
JScript, LISP, machine language, P-Code, microcode,
Modula-2, K-Man, MUMPS, Pascal, Prolog, pseudocode,
Python, QBASIC, VBASIC, query language, RPG,
Smalltalk, Turtle, BasicA, SQL, Tcl, UML, VBScript,
Visual Basic and Visual C++.
progressive rendering
Progressive rendering is a download method where the file
begins to display itself before the download is completed.
Downloading a graphic with some ISP's latest software and
most current browsers use this technique. It is also called
Smart Art, streamers, quick grafix and similar "catchy"
names.
protocol
A set of rules that governs how information is to be
exchanged between computer systems. See TCP/IP, SLIP
or PPP as an example of a protocol used to connect to the
Internet . Also used in certain structured chat rooms to
refer to the order in which people may speak.
PROM
1. An acronym for Programmable Read-Only Memory. A
type of read-only memory ( ROM) that allows data to be
written into the device with hardware called a PROM
programmer , often termed a burner. After a PROM has
been programmed, it is dedicated to that data, and it cannot
be reprogrammed. PROMs are part of the PLD family of
chips.
2. A wonderful social event of the 50's, 60's and 70's.
proxy
A server (actual hardware and software) that sits between a
client application, such as a Web browser, and a real
server. It intercepts all or designated requests to the real
server, local or distant, to see if it can fulfill the requests
itself. If not, it forwards the request to the real server.
Proxy servers have two main purposes:
1. Improve Performance: Proxy servers can dramatically
improve performance for groups of users. This is because it
saves the results of all requests for a certain amount of
time, in memory buffers of its own. Consider the case
where both user X and user Y access the World Wide Web
through a proxy server. First user X requests a certain Web
page, which we'll call Page 1. Sometime later, user Y
requests the same page. Instead of forwarding the request
to the Web server where Page 1 resides, which can be a
time-consuming operation, the proxy server simply returns
the Page 1 that it already fetched for user X. Since the
proxy server is often on the same network as the user, this
is a much faster operation than pulling the same
information more than once. Real proxy servers support
hundreds or thousands of users. The major online services
such as Compuserve and America Online, for example,
employ an array of proxy servers.
2. Filter Requests: Proxy servers can also be used to filter
requests, usually for security. For example, a company
might use a proxy server to prevent its employees from
accessing a specific set of Web sites. Those types of
applications are often used with FIREWALL functions to
give company LANs and servers protection both ways on
the Web. See ANALOGX.
PSTN
Short for Public Switched Telephone Network, which
refers to the international telephone system based on
copper wires carrying analog voice data. This is in contrast
to newer telephone networks base on digital technologies,
such as ISDN and FDDI. Telephone service carried by the
PSTN is often called plain old telephone service (POTS).
Most telephone companies are trying to filter data and
streaming services into one network and leave the PSTN
for mostly voice usage. See ISDL.
punt
Another phrase for being disconnected during your online
session. (i.e. - I was punted offline last night - probably for good reason!)
purge the cache
The effort to delete the files the web browser has stored
(cached) on your disk. These files were stored on your disk
so they could be retrieved quickly if you returned to the
same web sites. Sometimes when purging the cache,
cookies are also deleted. This usually requires that you
again fill out certain information at key sites you have
previously visited and have authorization to visit regularly.
This is not to be confused with "purge the cash", a term
often used and associated with the need to upgrade .
PVC
See permanent virtual circuit.
PWS
PWS is an abbreviation for one of the many Microsoft
products directed at making the distance from your desktop
to the Internet seem smaller, Personal Web Server. It is
also the acronym for Peer Web Services which is more or
less the same thing only based on NT. PWS is the baby
brother of IIS, Internet Information Server. Both products
are hybrid compilations and substitutes for an Internet
capable web server. PWS runs on the local operating
system, on the local hard disk, simulating a separate
computer to psuedo-serve pages to an Intranet or LAN, or
possibly the Internet under the most controlled of
conditions. PWS has virtually no security and is an
invitation to trouble if used in the "real world". PWS is a
simple HTML server used in a local office peer-to-peer
network that does support Microsoft's Front Page activities
and extensions. It was originally introduced for W95, later
migrated to NT4 and works with upward compatible
products from Microsoft. There is also a MAC version.
You can look at what Microsoft has to say about PWS and
also how to set up either flavor of PWS. The product has
never been terribly popular, probably because it is far more
efficient (and probably far less trouble) to set up a regular
server. Only a couple of pages on Microsoft's vast array of
servers are designated for information about the PWS
feebie as far as making it available to you. Roughly 340
pages are dedicated to troubleshooting it. Is there a clue
there?
