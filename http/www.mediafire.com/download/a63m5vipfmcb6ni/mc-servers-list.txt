DOWNLOAD THE ULTIMATE MINECRAFT SERVER LIST 


Why we started the download.

Our Minecraft Server List is here to help players find good multiplayer servers to play the very popular game called "Minecraft" and as of April 2013 the game has sold over 10 million copy's and is one of the hottest games online. 
  
 Scroll down and find a server list download that seems good for you - click on download now open the package to view the Minecraft servers Address (IP & Port) and paste it into your minecraft client at the Multiplayer option. If you want to run your own server then you could always get a minecraft server rental or you could even buy a minecraft server and if you really are serious about running a server then go for dedicated minecraft server hosting. 






Server information

We ping each server often to ensure they are online and then update the package accordingly.
 More than 100.000 Minecraft Servers monitored since the list started.


If a minecraft server goes offline it will first be displayed with a red number and after a couple of hours of downtime it will be removed from the list.
 If it remains offline for 14 days, it will be deleted from the system.

 

Over 1000 Servers contained in our main list!

Windows Batch Scripting: Return Codes - /* steve jansen☑

A very simple way to halt on error is to use the EXIT command with the /B switch (to exit the current batch script context, and not the command prompt process). We also pass a specific non-zero return code from the failed command to inform the caller of our script about the failure.
