Preface
The physical and social fabric of the United States is sustained by a system of systems;
a complex and dynamic network of interlocking and interdependent infrastructures
(“critical national infrastructures”) whose harmonious functioning enables the myriad
actions, transactions, and information flow that undergird the orderly conduct of civil
society in this country. The vulnerability of these infrastructures to threats — deliberate,
accidental, and acts of nature — is the focus of greatly heightened concern in the current
era, a process accelerated by the events of 9/11 and recent hurricanes, including Katrina
and Rita.
This report presents the results of the Commission’s assessment of the effects of a high
altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on our critical national infrastructures and
provides recommendations for their mitigation. The assessment is informed by analytic
and test activities executed under Commission sponsorship, which are discussed in this
volume. An earlier executive report, Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the
United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) — Volume 1: Executive Report (2004),
provided an overview of the subject.
The electromagnetic pulse generated by a high altitude nuclear explosion is one of a
small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences.
The increasingly pervasive use of electronics of all forms represents the greatest source
of vulnerability to attack by EMP. Electronics are used to control, communicate, compute,
store, manage, and implement nearly every aspect of United States (U.S.) civilian
systems. When a nuclear explosion occurs at high altitude, the EMP signal it produces
will cover the wide geographic region within the line of sight of the detonation.1 This
broad band, high amplitude EMP, when coupled into sensitive electronics, has the capability
to produce widespread and long lasting disruption and damage to the critical
infrastructures that underpin the fabric of U.S. society.
Because of the ubiquitous dependence of U.S. society on the electrical power system,
its vulnerability to an EMP attack, coupled with the EMP’s particular damage mechanisms,
creates the possibility of long-term, catastrophic consequences. The implicit invitation
to take advantage of this vulnerability, when coupled with increasing proliferation
of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems, is a serious concern. A single EMP attack
may seriously degrade or shut down a large part of the electric power grid in the geographic
area of EMP exposure effectively instantaneously. There is also a possibility of
functional collapse of grids beyond the exposed area, as electrical effects propagate from
one region to another.
The time required for full recovery of service would depend on both the disruption and
damage to the electrical power infrastructure and to other national infrastructures. Larger
affected areas and stronger EMP field strengths will prolong the time to recover. Some
critical electrical power infrastructure components are no longer manufactured in the
United States, and their acquisition ordinarily requires up to a year of lead time in routine
circumstances. Damage to or loss of these components could leave significant parts of the
electrical infrastructure out of service for periods measured in months to a year or more.
There is a point in time at which the shortage or exhaustion of sustaining backup systems,

1.5 million square miles, of Earth surface beneath the burst to a range of EMP field intensities.

including emergency power supplies, batteries, standby fuel supplies, communications,
and manpower resources that can be mobilized, coordinated, and dispatched, together
lead to a continuing degradation of critical infrastructures for a prolonged period of time.
Electrical power is necessary to support other critical infrastructures, including supply
and distribution of water, food, fuel, communications, transport, financial transactions,
emergency services, government services, and all other infrastructures supporting the
national economy and welfare. Should significant parts of the electrical power infrastructure
be lost for any substantial period of time, the Commission believes that the consequences
are likely to be catastrophic, and many people may ultimately die for lack of
the basic elements necessary to sustain life in dense urban and suburban communities. In
fact, the Commission is deeply concerned that such impacts are likely in the event of an
EMP attack unless practical steps are taken to provide protection for critical elements of
the electric system and for rapid restoration of electric power, particularly to essential
services. The recovery plans for the individual infrastructures currently in place essentially
assume, at worst, limited upsets to the other infrastructures that are important to
their operation. Such plans may be of little or no value in the wake of an EMP attack
because of its long-duration effects on all infrastructures that rely on electricity or
electronics.
The ability to recover from this situation is an area of great concern. The use of automated
control systems has allowed many companies and agencies to operate effectively
with small work forces. Thus, while manual control of some systems may be possible, the
number of people knowledgeable enough to support manual operations is limited. Repair
of physical damage is also constrained by a small work force. Many maintenance crews
are sized to perform routine and preventive maintenance of high-reliability equipment.
When repair or replacement is required that exceeds routine levels, arrangements are
typically in place to augment crews from outside the affected area. However, due to the
simultaneous, far-reaching effects from EMP, the anticipated augmenters likely will be
occupied in their own areas. Thus, repairs normally requiring weeks of effort may require
a much longer time than planned.
The consequences of an EMP event should be prepared for and protected against to the
extent it is reasonably possible. Cold War-style deterrence through mutual assured
destruction is not likely to be an effective threat against potential protagonists that are
either failing states or trans-national groups. Therefore, making preparations to manage
the effects of an EMP attack, including understanding what has happened, maintaining
situational awareness, having plans in place to recover, challenging and exercising those
plans, and reducing vulnerabilities, is critical to reducing the consequences, and thus
probability, of attack. The appropriate national-level approach should balance prevention,
protection, and recovery.
The Commission requested and received information from a number of Federal agencies
and National Laboratories. We received information from the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation, the President’s National Security Telecommunications
Advisory Committee, the National Communications System (since absorbed by the
Department of Homeland Security), the Federal Reserve Board, and the Department of
Homeland Security. Early in this review it became apparent that only limited EMP
vulnerability testing had been accomplished for modern electronic systems and
components. To partially remedy this deficit, the Commission sponsored illustrative

testing of current systems and infrastructure components. The Commission’s view is that
the Federal Government does not today have sufficiently robust capabilities for reliably
assessing and managing EMP threats.
The United States faces a long-term challenge to maintain technical competence for
understanding and managing the effects of nuclear weapons, including EMP. The
Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration have developed
and implemented an extensive Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Stewardship Program over the
last decade. However, no comparable effort was initiated to understand the effects that
nuclear weapons produce on modern systems. The Commission reviewed current national
capabilities to understand and to manage the effects of EMP and concluded that the
Country is rapidly losing the technical competence in this area that it needs in the
Government, National Laboratories, and Industrial Community.
An EMP attack on the national civilian infrastructures is a serious problem, but one that
can be managed by coordinated and focused efforts between industry and government. It
is the view of the Commission that managing the adverse impacts of EMP is feasible in
terms of time and resources. A serious national commitment to address the threat of an
EMP attack can develop a national posture that would significantly reduce the payoff for
such an attack and allow the United States to recover in a timely manner if such an attack
were to occur.

Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities
The physical and social fabric of the United States is sustained by a system of systems;
a complex and dynamic network of interlocking and interdependent infrastructures
(“critical national infrastructures”) whose harmonious functioning enables the myriad
actions, transactions, and information flow that undergird the orderly conduct of civil
society in this country. The vulnerability of these infrastructures to threats — deliberate,
accidental, and acts of nature — is the focus of heightened concern in the current era, a
process accelerated by the events of 9/11 and recent hurricanes, including Katrina and
Rita.
This volume focuses on a description of the potential vulnerabilities of our critical
national infrastructures to electromagnetic pulse (EMP) insult, and to that end, the chapters
in this document deal individually with the EMP threat to each critical infrastructure
separately. However, to set the stage for understanding the potential threat under conditions
in which all infrastructures are under simultaneous attack, it is important to realize
that the vulnerability of the whole — of all the highly interlocked critical infrastructures
— may be greater than the sum of the vulnerability of its parts. The whole is a highly
complex system of systems whose exceedingly dynamic and coordinated activity is
enabled by the growth of technology and where failure within one individual infrastructure
may not remain isolated but, instead, induce cascading failures into other
infrastructures.
It is also important to understand that not only mutual interdependence, and hence new
vulnerabilities, may be enabled by technology advances, but also technologies that have
facilitated this growing interdependence may be common across the many individual
infrastructures. In particular, the Commission thought it important to single out the growth
and common infrastructural infiltration of one particular transformative technology, the
development of automated monitoring and control systems — the ubiquitous robots of the
modern age known as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.
This opening chapter thus focuses on a more detailed description of these two aspects
of modern infrastructures, control systems and mutual interdependence, that are common
to all and which the Commission believes provide context and insight for understanding
sources of vulnerability in all the Nation’s infrastructures to EMP attack.
SCADA Systems
Introduction
SCADAs have emerged as critical and growing elements of a quietly unfolding industrial
revolution spurred by the computer age. The accelerating penetration of SCADA
systems, along with their electronic cousins, digital control systems (DCS) and programmable
logic controllers (PLC), as critical elements in every aspect of every critical infrastructure
in the Nation, is both inevitable and inexorable. While conferring economic
benefit and enormous new operational agility, the growing dependence of our infrastructures
on these omnipresent control systems represents a new vector of vulnerability in the
evolving digital age of the 21st century, such as cyber security. Such issues remain as a
matter for high-level concern and attention today. High-altitude EMP focuses our attention
toward another potential vulnerability of these systems, and one with potentially
vastly expanded consequences.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities

What Is a SCADA?
SCADAs are electronic control systems that may be used for data acquisition and control
over large and geographically distributed infrastructure systems. They find extensive use
in critical infrastructure applications such as electrical transmission and distribution,
water management, and oil and gas pipelines. SCADA technology has benefited from
several decades of development. It has its genesis in the telemetry systems used by the
railroad and aviation industries.
􀂋􀂋
In November 1999, San Diego County Water Authority and San Diego Gas and Electric companies
experienced severe electromagnetic interference to their SCADA wireless networks. Both companies
found themselves unable to actuate critical valve openings and closings under remote control of the
SCADA electronic systems. This inability necessitated sending technicians to remote locations to
manually open and close water and gas valves, averting, in the words of a subsequent letter of
complaint by the San Diego County Water Authority to the Federal Communications Commission, a
potential “catastrophic failure” of the aqueduct system. The potential consequences of a failure of this
825 million gallon per day flow rate system ranged from “spilling vents at thousands of gallons per
minute to aqueduct rupture with ensuing disruption of service, severe flooding, and related damage to
private and public property.” The source of the SCADA failure was later determined to be radar
operated on a ship 25 miles off the coast of San Diego.
The physical form of a SCADA may differ from application to application and from
one industry to another, but generally they all share certain generic commonalities. A
SCADA system physically bears close resemblance to the internals of a generic desktop
personal computer. Typically, it might contain familiar-appearing circuit boards, chips of
various sorts, and cable connectors to the external world. The cable connectors, in turn,
may be connected, perhaps quite remotely, to various sensor systems that are the
SCADA’s eyes and ears, as well as electronic control devices by which the SCADA may
issue commands that adjust system performance. Figure 1-1 provides an example of a
particular SCADA controller that is representative of many such systems.
Figure 1-1. Typical SCADA Architecture
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities

One major function of a SCADA — the data acquisition part of the acronym — is to
provide a capability to automatically and remotely monitor the operating state of a physical
system. It accomplishes this monitoring by providing an ongoing reporting of
parameters that either characterize the system’s performance, such as voltage or currents
developed in an electric power plant, flow volume in a gas pipeline, and net electrical
power delivered or received by a regional electrical system, or by monitoring environmental
parameters such as temperature in a nuclear power plant and sending an alarm
when prescribed operating conditions are exceeded.
The supervisory control function of a SCADA reflects the ability of these devices to
actively control the operation of the system by adjusting its output. For example, should
an electrical generating plant fail through loss of a critical hardware component or industrial
accident, the monitoring SCADA will detect the loss, issue an alert to the appropriate
authorities, and issue commands to other generating plants under its control to increase
their power output to match the load again. All these actions take place automatically,
within seconds, and without a human being involved in the immediate control loop.
A typical SCADA architecture for the electric power industry may consist of a centralized
computer — the master terminal unit (MTU) — communicating through many
remote terminal unit (RTU) subsystems, as illustrated in figure 1-2. The RTUs are used
in remote, unmanned locations where data acquisition and control tasks must be performed.
Examples of typical RTU data acquisition actions include processing signals
from sensors such as thermocouples, voltage sensors, or power meters and reporting the
state of equipment such as switch and circuit breaker positions. Typical control actions
include starting and stopping motors and controlling valves and circuit breakers.
Figure 1-2. Generic SCADA Architecture
DCSs share many functional and physical hardware similarities with SCADA systems.
A DCS typically will be used to control automated processes at a single location, such as
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities

an oil refinery or a chemical plant. In contrast, a SCADA typically might be sited in an
environment with dispersed assets where real-time situational awareness from remote
locations is a key element of centralized control. Most DCS installations control complex,
dynamic systems that would be difficult or impossible to control in a safe or economical
manner using only manual control.
Even a relatively straightforward process such as electrical power generation using a
conventional steam cycle requires highly complex systems to maximize efficiency, while
maintaining safety and environmental protection. For example, control systems in a
steam generating plant would include parameters such as generator speed, generator
lubrication oil pressure, excitation current and voltage output, feed water pressure and
boiler steam drum level, and air box pressure and rate of combustion.
Upset of these control points has the potential to cause severe physical damage. A case
in point is the boiler endpoints of combustion and circulation. Normally, the control system
would first reach the endpoint of combustion (limit of air and fuel adding energy into
the boiler) and, thus, prevent any thermal damage to the boiler. If the control system is
upset, it potentially could reach the endpoint of circulation (maximum rate of steam generation)
or endpoint of carryover (maximum rate at which water is not carried out of the
boiler) before the endpoint of combustion. This situation would cause thermal damage to
the boiler tubes or physical damage to steam turbine blades.
Normally, a PLC is used to control actuators or monitor sensors and is another piece of
hardware that shares many physical similarities to SCADAs and is often found as part of
a larger SCADA or DCS system. The SCADA, DCS, and PLC systems all share electronic
commonalities and, thus they share intrinsic electronic vulnerabilities as well.
SCADA systems, however, tend to be more geographically disposed and exposed; our
subsequent discussion focuses on SCADAs. When exposure or unprotected cable connectivity
is an issue, the discussion should be considered to pertain to both PLC and DCS
as well. See figure 1-3.
Figure 1-3. PLC Switch Actuator
EMP Interaction with SCADA
SCADA system components by their nature are frequently situated in remote environments
and operate without proximate human intervention. Although their critical electronic
elements usually are contained within some sort of metallic box, the enclosures’

service as a protective Faraday cage is typically minimal. Generally such metallic containers
are designed only to provide protection from the elements and a modicum of
physical security. They typically are not designed to protect the electronics from highenergy
electromagnetic pulses that may infiltrate either from the free field or from the
many antennae (cable connections) that may compromise electromagnetic integrity. The
major concern for SCADA vulnerability to EMP is focused on the early time E1 component
of the EMP signal. This is because, even in the power industry, SCADA systems
generally are not directly coupled electrically to the very long cable runs that might be
expected to couple to a late-time E3 signal.
To come to grips with the potential vulnerability of our critical national infrastructures
caused by a threat to these ubiquitous SCADA control systems, we must first develop a
sense of the vulnerability of the underlying hardware components themselves. To this
end, the EMP Commission sponsored and funded a series of tests of common SCADA
components in a government-owned EMP simulator (see figure 1-4). The simulation
testing provided an opportunity to observe the interaction of the electromagnetic energy
with equipment in an operational mode. Because the simulator did not completely replicate
all characteristics of a threat-level EMP environment, observed test results can be
related to the system’s response in more realistic scenarios through analysis and judgment
based on coupling differences between the simulated and real-world cases.
Figure 1-4. EMP Simulator with Test Structures and Internal Electronics
The Commission consulted with experts from industry groups associated with the
North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and by site and market surveys
to identify representative control systems for testing. A test matrix was developed that
reflected electronic control technologies employed in power generation, power distribution,
pipeline distribution, and manufacturing plants. Some test items assessed in this
effort are shown in figure 1-5.

Figure 1-5. Some of the Electronic Control Systems Exposed in Test Facility
EMP Simulation Testing
In this section, we provide a brief summary of the results of illuminating electronic
control systems in the simulator. The detailed results of the simulation test program are
documented separately in reports sponsored by the Commission. In Chapter 2, we
provide a more complete description of the test methodology, in which we discuss testing
carried out during assessment of the EMP vulnerability of the electric grid.
Many of the control systems that we considered achieved operational connectivity
through Ethernet cabling. EMP coupling of electrical transients to the cables proved to be
an important vulnerability during threat illumination. Because the systems would require
manual repair, their full restoration could be a lengthy process. A simple model of four
Ethernet cables from a router to four personal computers (PC) was generated to quantify
the impact of cable length. The configuration of this model is shown in figure 1-6. The
results of the analysis indicate that the coupling to the 200 feet of Ethernet line is roughly
seven times the transient level on the 25-foot line measured during the test program. The
testing and analysis indicate that the electronics could be expected to see roughly 100 to
700 ampere current transients on typical Ethernet cables. Effects noted in the EMP testing
occurred at the lower end of this scale.
The bottom line observation at the end of the testing was that every system tested failed
when exposed to the simulated EMP environment. The failures were not identical from
system to system or within a system. For example, a device with many input-output ports
might exhibit degraded performance on one port, physical damage on another, and no
effect on a third. Control units might report operating parameters at variance with their
post illumination reality or fail to control internal flows. The Commission considered the
implications of these multiple simultaneous control system failures to be highly significant
as potential contributors to a widespread system collapse.
Impact of SCADA Vulnerabilities on Critical Infrastructures:

experience some type of impact. As the test results were briefed to industry experts at
NERC and the Argonne National Laboratory, it became apparent that even minor effects
noted during the testing could significantly affect the processes and equipment being
controlled. Putting together a complete analysis for complex processes associated with
infrastructure systems is extremely difficult. Developing the ability to analyze or model
these impacts is beyond the scope of this effort.
To provide insight into the potential impact of these EMP-induced electronic system
malfunctions, one can consider the details of historical events. In these cases, similar (and
arguably less severe) system malfunctions have produced consequences in situations that
are far too complex to predict beforehand using a model or analysis.
Another important observation is that these incidents are seldom the result of a single
factor. Rather they are a combination of unexpected events that, only in hindsight, are
easily related to the impact. This is not surprising given the complexity of the systems
involved. Before considering the historical database, it is important to remember that
historical examples, although important for the insight they provide into the dependence
of a functioning modern infrastructure on its automated eyes, ears, and remote controllers,
do not adequately capture the scale of the expected EMP scenario. In the latter, it is
not one or a few SCADA systems that are malfunctioning (the typical historical scenario),
but large numbers — hundreds or even thousands — with some fraction of those
rendered permanently inoperable until replaced or physically repaired.
Significant historical events that provide insight into the potential impact of damage or
upset to control systems include Hurricane Katrina; the 1996 Western States blackout; the
August 14, 2003, Northeast blackout; a geomagnetic storm in 1989; the June 10, 1999,
Bellingham pipeline incident; the August 19, 2000, Carlsbad pipeline incident; the July
24, 1994, Pembroke, United Kingdom, refinery incident; and a Netherlands electromagnetic
interference (EMI) incident. The following paragraphs discuss the relevance of four
of these incidents to an EMP event. The other four incidents — Hurricane Katrina; the
Western States blackout; the August 14, 2003, blackout; and the 1989 geomagnetic storm
— are described in Chapter 2, which is dedicated to a discussion of EMP effects on the
electric power grid.
Bellingham Pipeline Incident. On June 10, 1999, one of the Olympic pipelines transporting
gasoline ruptured in the Whatcom Falls Park area of Bellingham, Washington.
About 250,000 gallons of gasoline from the pipeline entered the Hannah and Whatcom
Creeks, where the fuel ignited, resulting in three fatalities and eight injuries. In addition,
the banks of the creek were destroyed over a 1.5-mile section, and several buildings adjacent
to the creek were severely damaged.

Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities

Causes included improperly set relief valves, delayed maintenance inspections, and
SCADA system discrepancies. The effects all came together at the same time that
changes in pipeline operations were occurring. Given the wide area of an EMP, it is conceivable
that some of the pipelines affected could also suffer from poor maintenance. The
electronic disturbance of an EMP event could be expected to precipitate SCADA failures
and the ensuing loss of valve controls.
Carlsbad Pipeline Incident. On August 19, 2000, an explosion occurred on one of three
adjacent large natural gas pipelines near Carlsbad, New Mexico, operated by the El Paso
Natural Gas Company. The pipelines supply consumers and electric utilities in Arizona
and Southern California. Twelve people, including five children, died as a result of the
explosion. The explosion left an 86-foot-long crater. After the pipeline failure, the
Department of Transportation’s Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) ordered the pipeline to
be shut down. The explosion happened because of failures in maintenance and loss of
situational awareness, conditions that would be replicated by data acquisition disruptions
caused by an EMP event.
Pembroke Refinery Incident. On July 24, 1994, a severe thunderstorm passed over the
Pembroke refinery in the United Kingdom. Lightning strikes resulted in a 0.4 second
power loss and subsequent power dips throughout the refinery. Consequently, numerous
pumps and overhead fin-fan coolers tripped repeatedly, resulting in the main crude column
pressure safety valves lifting and major upsets in the process units in other refinery
units, including those within the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) complex.
There was an explosion in the FCC unit and a number of isolated fires continued to
burn at locations within the FCC, butamer, and alkylation units. The explosion was
caused by flammable hydrocarbon liquid continuously being pumped into a process vessel
that, because of a valve malfunction, had its outlet closed. The control valve was actually
shut when the control system indicated that it was open. The malfunctioning process
control system did not allow the refinery operators to contain the situation.
As a result of this incident, an estimated 10 percent of the total refining capacity in the
United Kingdom was lost until this complex was returned to service. The business loss is
estimated at $70 million, which reflects 4.5 months of downtime. The disturbances
caused by the lightning strikes — power loss and degradation — would also result from
an EMP event.
Netherlands EMI Incident. A mishap occurred at a natural gas pipeline SCADA system
located about 1 mile from the port of Den Helder, Netherlands, in the late 1980s. A
SCADA disturbance caused a catastrophic failure of an approximately 36-inch diameter
pipeline, which resulted in a large gas explosion.
This failure was caused by EMI traced to a radar coupling into the wires of the SCADA
system. Radio frequency energy caused the SCADA system to open and close at the radar
scan frequency, a relay that was, in turn, controlling the position of a large gas flowcontrol
valve. The resulting changes in valve position created pressure waves that
traveled down the pipeline and eventually caused the pipeline to fail. This incident shows
the potential damage to pipelines from improper control system operations, a condition
that could be replicated by an EMP event.

Summary
SCADA systems are vulnerable to EMP insult. The large numbers and widespread reliance
on such systems by all of the Nation’s critical infrastructures represent a systemic
threat to their continued operation following an EMP event. Additionally, the necessity to
reboot, repair, or replace large numbers of geographically widely dispersed systems will
considerably impede the Nation’s recovery from such an assault.
Infrastructures and Their Interdependencies
Introduction
All critical national infrastructures are fault tolerant to some degree. Design engineers
and system managers are cognizant of, and fully expect, failure of subsystems and individual
electrical components. Networks are designed with an expressed goal to avoid single
point failures that can bring down the entire system, though in practice the evolved
network may be so complicated that no one can guarantee that this design goal has been
achieved. Single point failures are anticipated in the design of the systems and engineering
solutions of various kinds, including redundancy, rapid repair, replacement, and
operational rerouting.
It is important to note, however, that safeguards against single point failures generally
depend on the proper functioning of the rest of the national infrastructure, a plausible
assumption for high-reliability infrastructure systems when they experience random,
uncorrelated single point failures.
Planning for multiple failures, particularly when they are closely correlated in time, is
much less common. It is safe to say that no one has planned for, and few have even
imagined, a scenario with the loss of hundreds or even thousands of nodes across all the
critical national infrastructures, all simultaneously. That, however, is precisely the circumstance
contemplated by an EMP attack scenario.
The ability to predict the consequences
of failure within a critical infrastructure
will require the use of reliable modeling
and simulation tools. Some tools exist for
the individual infrastructures and serve as
either planning tools, real-time control
models, or operational support elements to
allocate or control resources during
network outages and restoration activities.
They are generally validated within the parameter space of normal operating experience
and concern, and they serve their purposes well. But it is also recognized that the systems
being modeled are so complex that currently available modeling tools cannot capture the
full richness of potential system responses to all possible network configurations and
operating states.
Thus, for example, on the order of once a decade or so, portions of the national power
grid will experience an unpredicted major disruption with failures cascading through
some of the network pathways. Following the major Northeast power blackout of August
14, 2003, analysts continued to debate the cause of the disruption. The sophisticated,
relatively mature, and operationally deployed modeling and simulation tools have not
been able to replicate unambiguously the observed events of August 14.

that we cannot possibly anticipate

failures; we add safety devices that

The scenarios envisioned by an EMP attack involve potential failures distributed across
a wide geographical extent. These include multiple combinations of node failures, a condition
that generally is outside the parameter space of validation of extant system models
and poses a severe challenge to predicting the subsequent evolution of the infrastructure
response. The response of critical national infrastructures to an EMP attack is precisely
the subject of many sections of this report. But there is a particular aspect of modeling
infrastructures that is even less well developed and whose particular relevance to the
EMP scenario stresses the current state of the simulation art to produce a high-fidelity
simulation. That aspect is the interaction among the different infrastructures. Particularly
difficult to anticipate and to capture in simulations are situations in which the occurrence
of simultaneous failures can bring into play dormant and hitherto hidden interaction
pathways in which a destructively synergistic amplification of failure, normally locally
contained, may be propagated through the network at large.
Charles Perrow1 in particular has drawn attention to these types of failures, which he
has termed normal accidents and which are posited as an inherent property of any tightly
coupled system once a threshold of complexity has been passed. The Commission
believes that, given sufficient priority, time and resources, complex interdependent models
can be developed to guide future assessments of the U.S. national infrastructure to
EMP attack and to guide investment decisions on how best to protect our infrastructures.
Complex Interactions
Various lists are in circulation that identify the critical infrastructures. The EMP Commission
has chosen to address the following areas in separate sections of this Commission
report:
􀂋 Electric power
􀂋 Telecommunications
􀂋 Banking and finance
􀂋 Petroleum and natural gas
􀂋 Transportation
􀂋 Food
􀂋 Water
􀂋 Emergency services
􀂋 Space
􀂋 Government
The separation of these infrastructures into different domains tends to obscure the real
interdependencies that sustain the effectiveness and daily operation of each one.
As a simple example, the telecommunications infrastructure requires power that is
delivered by the power infrastructure. If power delivery is disrupted by disturbances in
the power grid, telecommunication substations will run for a while on reserve battery
power but would then need to switch to reserve backup generators (if they have them).
The generator’s operation would rely on fuel, first from on-site storage and then conveyed
to a central distribution point by the energy distribution infrastructure and delivered
to the telecommunications substation by the transportation infrastructure and paid
for by the components of the financial infrastructure. The technicians who show up,

through the transportation infrastructure, to
make repairs would not do so unless they
have been sustained by the food and water
delivery infrastructures, and so forth. In turn,
a functioning telecommunications system
provides critical situational awareness and
control to a power infrastructure that must
keep its power generation in balance with its
load in a dynamic control process over a
very large geographical area. Telecommunications
also plays a critical role in controlling the transportation system and is the basis of
data exchange within the financial infrastructure. The complex interdependence between
elements within each infrastructure is suggested and illustrated schematically but by no
means wholly characterized by figure 1-7.
In the course of ordinary interruptions, many of these infrastructure interdependencies
and interactions can be safely ignored. In an EMP attack scenario, the immediate insult is
expected to affect the different infrastructures simultaneously through multiple electronic
component disruptions and failures over a wide geographical area. Understanding these
cross-cutting interdependencies and interactions is critical to assessing the capability of
the full system of interdependent critical infrastructures to recover. The modeling and
simulation needed to explore the response of such a complex situation involves a large
but finite number of elements and should be amenable to analysis, at least approximately,
but little effort has been made to address the problem to date.
In practice, understanding the interdependence may be a difficult task because subject
area experts are not necessarily attuned to coupling mechanisms that span the boundary
between their respective discipline and another, and because an accurate representation of
the interdependence requires a familiarity with transdisciplinary phenomena.
Experience demonstrates that it is sometimes easy to overlook the less obvious roles
that such interdependencies and interactions may play, and coupling pathways may be
easily overlooked. As an example, many of the recovery procedures developed by
organizations to deal with emergencies involve the implicit assumption that transportation
is available and people will be put on airplanes and go somewhere to diagnose and
repair something. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, all civilian airplanes were
grounded. In 1991, a single point failure inside the telecommunications system, the accidental
severing of a single fiber-optic cable in the New York City region, not only
blocked 60 percent of all calls into and out of New York, but also disabled all air traffic
control functions from Washington, D.C., to Boston — the busiest flight corridor in the
Nation — and crippled the operations of the New York Mercantile Exchange.2 These key
interdependencies were always there, but they were not recognized as warranting
advanced contingency planning, situational awareness in degraded conditions, and
operational workarounds.

Recent Studies and Organizational Activities
Infrastructure vulnerability has been the subject of recent high-level attention with three
separate congressionally chartered commissions devoted to the topic, including the President’s
Commission on Critical Infrastructures (the Marsh Commission), the EMP
Commission and The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences.
The latter issued a report, Making the Nation Safer: The Role of Science and Technology
in Countering Terrorism in 2002, which explores potential vulnerabilities in the same list
of critical infrastructures cited in the previous section. Both commissions noted the lack
of a mature modeling and simulation capability as a significant weakness in the
protective toolset available to planners and those charged with the mission of shielding
our key infrastructures from subversion or other disruption. The National Academy of
Sciences study, in particular, recommended the development of an analytic capability
based on systems engineering principles.
An organizational response is beginning as well. For example, the Department of
Homeland Security has absorbed and reorganized the National Infrastructures Analysis
Center (NIAC), as well as the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center
(NISAC). Many other government agencies and organizations have organized critical
infrastructure protection organizations. Important infrastructure modeling work has been
sponsored by the Government in such organizations as the Department of Energy’s
Argonne National Laboratory and National Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA)
laboratories at Sandia and Los Alamos.
Critical infrastructure studies also have been a growing activity in academia with the
participation of individual scholars at various universities around the country. A number
of academic centers have also set up or spun off entire institutes devoted to the analysis
of critical infrastructural matters. The University of Virginia has created the Center for
Risk Management, which focuses on the application of input-output econometric models
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities
13
to analysis of critical infrastructures. In addition, George Mason and James Madison universities
in Virginia have created the Center for Infrastructure Protection Programs
(CIPP). The Santa Fe Institute of Complexity Studies also has pursued important theoretical
work, and there are many other examples as well.
These efforts, as well as other important related work, are pointing in the right direction.
Nevertheless, the bottom-line is that currently an adequate capability to model individual
infrastructures on a national scale does not exist. Moreover, the capability to
develop and integrate a fully interactive and coupled set of national-scale infrastructure
models is not being pursued with sufficient priority and support to achieve it in the
foreseeable future.
Commission-Sponsored Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Activities
As the Commission embarked on its task, it attempted to engage existing capabilities
within academia, industry, and government to simulate the behavior of infrastructures
subjected to stressful disruption. To that end, it initiated the following activities.
National Workshop. The EMP Commission sponsored a national workshop on the
modeling and simulation of interdependent interacting infrastructures as part of an effort
to understand the state of modeling capability in this country and to identify capabilities
that might be exploited to provide insight into the expected effects of a prescribed EMP
attack scenario. A number of national experts who are working on related modeling and
simulation activities participated. The Commission has exploited some of these capabilities
to develop insight that helped inform the assessment provided by the Commission’s
full report.
Contractual Activities. Current modeling and simulation tools are not sufficient to
provide a realistic predictive capability for the interdependent infrastructures.
Nevertheless, the modeling capability proved useful in developing the Commission’s
insight into the effects of coupling on the overall impact due to the attack and the
expected recovery and restoration effort. The Commission examined such questions as:
Does a strong or weak coupling tend to drive the models to longer or shorter infrastructure
restoration times? What seemed to be the sensitive parameters? What sorts of
decoupling activities might be suggested to shorten reconstitution efforts? The examination
of these and similar questions was supported by a number of efforts the Commission
initiated with the NISAC, the University of Virginia, and Argonne National Laboratory.
Some of the results of these efforts are summarized in the following section.
EMP Commission Staff Analyses. The EMP Commission staff also developed analytic
products to explore issues of stability and instability related to infrastructural coupling
models. In particular, the Commission focused on models that coupled the power to the
telecommunication infrastructure in an interactive way.
The results of these efforts have informed the Commission’s findings, as documented
in this volume.
Illustrative Modeling and Simulation Results for Coupled Infrastructures
To illustrate some of the complex behavior that can arise when coupling between infrastructures
is included, consider the simple case of the interaction of only two infrastructures,
here taken to be the telecommunication and power networks. The telecommunication
networks themselves are in the midst of a rapid evolution that has seen data communications,
which represented only 10 percent of the total traffic in 1990, grow to about 50
percent of the daily telecommunications load, with the expectation that voice traffic will
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 1. Infrastructure Commonalities
14
represent only a small fraction of the traffic by 2015. There is a corresponding ongoing
evolution, both in the network architecture and the underlying hardware, that is described
in more detail in Chapter 3 of this report.
A critical element of the network of the future will be reliance on public data networks
(PDNs). In the past, the electric power grid relied on its own communication system to
monitor and control the grid, and mutual dependence between the power and telecommunications
systems was essentially nil. Today the power grid relies on PDNs for about 15
percent of its telecommunication needs, and this figure is expected to grow to 50 percent
in the near future. Figure 1-8 illustrates the expected interdependence for this evolving
network.
The PDNs represent networks powered by the power distribution network. The power
generation and distribution network is, in turn, controlled by SCADA systems that
depend on telecommunications to provide situational awareness and to execute control
functions for the power grid. Figure 1-9 represents the results of a model simulation. The
telecommunication network reverts back to a dependence on commercial power while
both are in the recovery phase. The power infrastructure continues to depend in part on
the probability of call blocking, while the recovery for telecommunications depends on
the available power.
The figure shows four distinct phases of a recovery process — an early phase extending
to about a half hour, during which many network elements execute reinitializations to
restore some service with power generally available from battery backup, to a phase of
interdependency, during which the only power option left is reliance on the commercial
grid, which in turn is dependent on a commercial PDN. This model can provide insight
into the recovery process. It predicts significantly lengthened recovery times because of
infrastructure interdependence, compared to recovery analysis that examines an infrastructure
in isolation, ignoring the factor of interdependence. While illustrative of the
effects of interdependency, this model is not meant to represent the actual behavior of
any specific real-world system today.

In another effort, the NISAC studied the consequences of an EMP attack scenario4
involving a large EMP source located at high altitude off the California coastline. The
simulation looked at the effects on water, electric power, telecommunications, natural
gas, refined petroleum products, transportation, labor and economic sector productivity
and attempted to capture their known interactions. The simulation included network
models for the transfer of information and infrastructure products, services, markets, and
process models for each product and service. The boundary conditions for the simulation
were provided by the EMP Commission; for study purposes, they included descriptions
of the potential initial states of both the power and telecommunication infrastructures
immediately following exposure to the EMP environment. The simulation, which was not
considered realistic because it did not consider likely physical damage that would impede
any recovery process, was still useful in providing insight into the potential for disturbances
in one infrastructure to cascade into others.
Summary
No currently available modeling and simulation tools exist that can adequately address
the consequences of disruptions and failures occurring simultaneously in different critical
infrastructures that are dynamically interdependent. Many infrastructure models that do
exist are local to regional in scope.
The Federal Government is supporting a number of initiatives to develop critical
national infrastructure modeling and simulation capability as a national analysis and
planning resource. However, these are not high national priorities and are funded at less

than critical mass. They also are fragmented and uncoordinated, which is not an entirely
negative observation, as the complexity of the task merits exploration of independent
research and development approaches.
Recent analytic work suggests that evolving interdependencies may be inadvertently
introducing entirely new and potentially serious vulnerabilities that could lead to infrastructure
failures, even without the precipitating catalyst of an EMP attack.
Recommendations
􀂋 The Commission recommends that research be conducted to better understand infrastructure
system interdependencies and interactions, along with the effects of various
EMP attack scenarios. In particular, the Commission recommends that such research
include a strong component of interdependency modeling. Funding could be directed
through a number of avenues, including through the National Science Foundation and
the Department of Homeland Security.
􀂋 The Commission recognizes current interest in protecting SCADA systems from electronic
cyber assault. The Commission recommends that such activities be expanded to
address the vulnerability of SCADA systems to other forms of electronic assault, such
as EMP.

Chapter 2. Electric Power
Introduction
The functioning of society and the economy is critically dependent upon the availability
of electricity. Essentially every aspect of American society requires electrical power to
function. Contemporary U.S. society is not structured, nor does it have the means, to provide
for the needs of nearly 300 million Americans without electricity. Continued electrical
supply is necessary for sustaining water supplies, production and distribution of food,
fuel, communications, and everything else that is a part of our economy. Continuous,
reliable electrical supply within very tight frequency boundaries is a critical element to
the continued existence and growth of the United States and most developed countries.
For most Americans, production of goods and services and most of life’s activities stop
during a power outage. Not only is it impossible to perform many everyday domestic and
workplace tasks, but also people must divert their time to dealing with the consequences
of having no electricity. In the extreme, they must focus on survival itself. The situation
is not different for the economy at large. No other infrastructure could, by its own collapse
alone, create such an outcome. All other infrastructures rely on electric power.
Conversely, the electric power infrastructure is dependent on other infrastructures that are
themselves vulnerable to the direct effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) in ways that
are described elsewhere in this report. No infrastructure other than electric power has the
potential for nearly complete collapse in the event of a sufficiently robust EMP attack.
While a less robust attack could result in less catastrophic outcomes, those outcomes
would still have serious consequences and threaten national security.
The electrical power system is the largest single capital-intensive infrastructure in
North America. It is an enormously complex system of systems containing fuel production,
gathering and delivery systems, electrical generators (often themselves systems),
electrical transmission systems, control systems of all types, and distribution systems
right down to the electrical outlet and interconnection at the point of use. It is this vast
array of systems and components all acting in concert, integrated into a cohesive whole to
deliver electrical power at the point of use, with supply-on-demand at a uniform frequency
that provides the reliable, steady, and adequate electric supply on which everyone
has come to expect and depend. Because of the integration and interdependence of the
electric system’s components and the ever growing shift to electronics and particularly
microelectronics for operation, protection and control, the Nation is particularly vulnerable
to a major disruption of the electric supply.
Today, the existing electrical system at peak demand periods increasingly operates at or
near reliability limits of its physical capacity. Modern electronics, communications, protection,
control and computers have allowed the physical system to be utilized fully with
ever smaller margins for error. Therefore, a relatively modest upset to the system can
cause functional collapse. As the system grows in complexity and interdependence, restoration
from collapse or loss of significant portions of the system becomes exceedingly
difficult. Over the last decade or two, relatively few new large-capacity electric
transmission capabilities have been constructed and most of the additions to generation
capacity that have been made have been located considerable distances from load for
environmental, political, and economic reasons, adding stress and further limiting the
system’s ability to withstand disruption. Significant elements of the system, including
many generating plants, are aging (a considerable number are more than 50 years old)
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
18
and becoming less reliable or are under pressure to be retired for environmental
considerations, further exacerbating the situation.
Should the electrical power system be lost for any substantial period of time, the Commission
believes that the consequences are likely to be catastrophic to civilian society.
Machines will stop; transportation and communication will be severely restricted; heating,
cooling, and lighting will cease; food and water supplies will be interrupted; and
many people may die. “Substantial period” is not quantifiable but generally outages that
last for a week or more and affect a very large geographic region without sufficient support
from outside the outage area would qualify. EMP represents such a threat; it is one
event that may couple ultimately unmanageable currents and voltages into an electrical
system routinely operated with little margin and cause the collapse of large portions of
the electrical system. In fact, the Commission is deeply concerned that such impacts are
certain in an EMP event unless practical steps are taken to provide protection for critical
elements of the electric system and to provide for rapid restoration of service, particularly
to essential loads.
The electrical power system routinely experiences disruptions. In most cases, the cause
is the failure of one or a small number of components. The overall system has a degree of
durability against such failures, although in some cases failures lead to a cascading loss
of power up to a regional level that extends over relatively short to moderate periods of
time. The current strategy for recovering from such failures is based on the assumption of
sporadic failures of small numbers of components, and for larger failures, drawing on
resources from outside the affected area. This strategy leaves us ill-prepared to respond
effectively to an EMP attack that would potentially result in damage to vast numbers of
components nearly simultaneously over an unprecedented geographic scale.
The Commission recognizes that EMP is one of several threats to the overall electrical
power system. Some of these threats are naturally occurring, such as geomagnetic storms.
Others, like attacks using information operations on the system’s controls, are manmade.
There are strong similarities in the types of damage resulting from the occurrence of such
threats. There are also similarities in the measures that are appropriate to be undertaken to
reduce the electrical power system’s vulnerability to each of these threats. The
Commission believes that the measures it recommends will both reduce the vulnerability
of the electrical power system to these threats and improve the Nation’s ability to recover
the system.
The magnitude of an EMP event varies with the type, design and yield of the weapon,
as well as its placement. The Commission has concluded that even a relatively modest-tosmall
yield weapon of particular characteristics, using design and fabrication information
already disseminated through licit and illicit means, can produce a potentially devastating
E1 field strength over very large geographical regions. This followed by E2 impacts, and
in some cases serious E3 impacts operating on electrical components left relatively
unprotected by E1, can be extremely damaging. (E3 requires a greater yield to produce
major effects.) Indeed, the Commission determined that such weapon devices not only
could be readily built and delivered, but also the specifics of these devices have been
illicitly trafficked for the past quarter-century. The field strengths of such weapons may
be much higher than those used by the Commission for testing threshold failure levels of
electrical system components and subsystems.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
19
Additionally, analyses available from foreign sources suggest that amplitudes and frequency
content of EMP fields from bomb blasts calculated by U.S. analysts may be too
low. While this matter is a highly technical issue that awaits further investigation by U.S.
scientific experts, it raises the specter of increased uncertainty about the adequacy of
current U.S. EMP mitigation approaches.
A key issue for the Commission in assessing the impact of such a disruption to the
Nation’s electrical system was not only the unprecedented widespread nature of the outage
(e.g., the cascading effects from even one or two relatively small weapons exploded
in optimum location in space at present would almost certainly shut down an entire interconnected
electrical power system, perhaps affecting as much as 70 percent or possibly
more of the United States, all in an instant) but more significantly widespread damage
may well adversely impact the time to recover and thus have a potentially catastrophic
impact.
For highly dependent systems such as commercial telecommunications and the financial
system, electric power is frequently filtered through batteries. These act to condition
the power as well as to provide limited backup. Local, at-site emergency generators are
used quite extensively for high priority loads. These include hospitals, cold storage, water
systems, airport controls, rail controls and similar uses. These systems, however, are
themselves increasingly dependent on electronics to initiate start up, segregate them from
the larger power system, and control their operating efficiency, thereby rendering them
vulnerable to EMP.
Furthermore, emergency generators have relatively short-term fuel supplies, generally
less than 72 hours. Increasingly, locally stored fuel in buildings and cities is being
reduced for fire safety (after 9/11) and environmental pollution reasons, so that emergency
generation availability without refueling is becoming even more limited. Batteries
normally have a useful life well short of emergency generators, often measured in a few
hours. All of these tools for maintaining a stable and adequate power supply, even to high
priority loads, are intended to be temporary at best – bridging the time until restoration
can take place.
The impact of such an EMP-triggered outage would be severe but not catastrophic if
the recovery was rapid or the geographic impact sufficiently limited. The recovery times
from previous large-scale outages have been on the order of one to several days. This
record of quick recovery is attributable to the remarkably effective operation of protective
systems and communications that are an essential part of the power infrastructure and the
multiple sources of replacement components from surrounding nonimpacted systems. In
this context, a short blackout scenario over a relatively small geographic region would be
economically painful. Of the more than $10 trillion U.S. Gross Domestic Product, about
three percent is electricity sales. However, estimates of economic loss from historical
blackouts range from factors of six (for domestic customers) to 20 (for industrial users)
times the value of the interrupted service. By these measures, the economic impact of an
outage is between 18 and 60 percent of total production in the affected area. Again, this
estimate is for reasonably short-lived blackouts. A short blackout presents no threat to
national survival.
On the other hand, a geographically widespread blackout that involves physical damage
to thousands of components may produce a persistent outage that would far exceed historical
experience, with potentially catastrophic effect. Simulation work sponsored by the
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
20
Commission at the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) has
suggested that, after a few days, what little production that does take place would be offset
by accumulating loss of perishables, collapse of businesses, loss of the financial systems
and dislocation of the work force. The consequences of lack of food, heat (or air
conditioning), water, waste disposal, medical, police, fire fighting support, and effective
civil authority would threaten society itself.
The Commission solicited technical assistance and judgment from the North American
Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC, which is governed by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission [FERC] guidelines); utilities with particularly relevant experience
(such as with geomagnetic storms [similar to E3]; long or very high voltage transmission;
uniquely sensitive generation, special fault testing; and similar aspects); suppliers of
protection, control, and other related equipment; groups dealing with industry standards;
organizations of utilities, fuel suppliers, fuel transportation groups; select academic,
national, and internationally recognized experts, the Department of Energy (DOE)
National Laboratories, and relevant governmental entities. Willingness to be helpful was
uniformly positive and generous. The Commission is grateful for this support.
NERC was uniquely well suited to be of assistance. NERC was established in the
aftermath of the 1965 Northeast Power Failure to enhance the reliability of the electrical
system. The Commission briefed the NERC Board of Trustees on the nature of the threat
and the potential vulnerability. The NERC Board established an EMP task force under
the aegis of its Critical Infrastructure Protection Advisory Group to provide technical
advice to the Commission. The expertise of the task force membership spanned the three
NERC Interconnects (Eastern, Western States Coordinating Council [WSSC], and Electric
Reliability Council of Texas [ERCOT]), and all three major categories of the system
(generation, transmission, and distribution).
This group’s involvement was an essential element in focusing the Commission on the
importance of the early-time EMP pulse and its implications for recovery, as well as on
other triggers of widespread impact. It also provided technical input that was very helpful
in implementing and interpreting a Commission-sponsored test program targeted at identifying
the threshold at which significant control and protective components for the electrical
system would begin to fail through disruption, false data, and damage. Many of the
technical and operational insights discussed within the report were influenced by this task
force although the NERC Task Force did not otherwise directly participate in the drafting
of the report or in its conclusions.
Description
Major Elements
There are three major elements of the electrical power infrastructure: (1) generation, (2)
transmission (relatively high voltage for long distances), and (3) distribution, whose elements
are interdependent, yet distinct (see figure 2-1).
Generation. Power plants convert energy that is in some other form into electricity. The
initial form of the energy can be mechanical (hydro, wind, or wave), chemical (hydrogen,
coal, petroleum, refuse, natural gas, petroleum coke, or other solid combustible fuel),
thermal (geothermal or solar), or nuclear. Power plants can range from single solar cells
to huge central station complexes. In most circumstances the first stage of generation
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
21
converts the original form of energy into rotational mechanical energy, as occurs in a turbine.
The turbine then drives a generator.
Power System Overview
Figure 2-1. Power System Overview
Modern power plants all utilize complex protection and control systems to maximize
efficiency and provide safety. They all have common electrical characteristics in order
for them to be useable by all the various purposes to which electricity is put. Electronics
have largely replaced all the electromechanical devices in older plants and are used
exclusively in plants of the past one or two decades. Even generator exciters now have
microprocessors and analog-to-digital converters. These electronics and, thus, the power
plant itself are highly vulnerable to EMP assault. Identifying and locating damaged generation
plant equipment with electronic sensors and communication interdicted and/or
unreliable due to EMP and repairing the system would be a complex and time-consuming
process, even when personnel and parts are readily available.
The fossil fuel supply system (coal, oil, wood, and natural gas) is largely dependent on
electronics for its production and delivery of adequate fuel to the generators to produce
nearly 75 percent of the Nation’s electricity. There should not be a direct and immediate
impact on the fuel supply for a nuclear power plant. The interdependency between the
fuel necessary to generate electricity and the electricity and electronics to deliver the fuel
is critical to the recovery. For example, natural gas normally is delivered just in time
while oil and coal have some at-site storage. Nuclear generation supplies a major portion
of the remainder of the Nation’s electricity. It is unlikely for the timing of an EMP attack
to be such that it would directly and immediately impact the fuel supply for a nuclear
power plant. Of the balance, hydroelectric plants have their own fuel supplies as do geothermal,
solar, and wind systems. However, wind and solar may or may not be generating
in any event, given their inherent uncertainty. Hydro and geothermal are significant capabilities,
but they are highly localized.
Transmission. Electrical power from the various power plants travels over a system of
lines and substations to the regions and locales where it will be consumed. The transmission
system moves large amounts of power generally over substantial distances and/or to
directly serve very large electrical loads. This definition separates it from the distribution
system, which is described below. Transmission includes lines (wires strung from insuCRITICAL
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
22
lator strings on towers or underground in special insulated containers) and substations
(nodal points where several lines intersect and protection and control functions are
implemented). Within substations there are transformers (which transform power from
one voltage to another); breakers (similar to on-and-off switches able to handle the large
amounts of energy passing through); and protective devices, meters, and data transmitting
and control systems. Protective devices protect the electrical components from unusual
electrical disturbances that occur from time to time for many different reasons as well as
for general safety reasons.
The delivery of electrical power across or through some medium, such as a wire,
encounters resistance, which itself takes power to overcome. Electrical power is measured
by the product of voltage and current. The electrical resistive losses (restricting the
flow) are proportional to the square of the current. Thus it is most efficient to transmit
power at the minimum current that is practical (this results in the highest voltage for the
same amount of power). Otherwise, more power is consumed just to push the electricity
through or over a path with higher resistance.
Standard values for modern alternating current (AC) transmission line voltage range
from 115 kV (115 thousand volts) to 765 kV, although some 1100 kV transmission has
been developed and tested. The current carried by these lines is typically up to a few
thousand amperes. Direct current (DC) is also used in some instances for moving large
amounts of power great distances and for controlling the flow itself. The normal point of
use of electricity is AC and thus the shift from AC to DC and back from DC to AC makes
DC uneconomical other than in special circumstances. The use of DC is increasing, however,
as power costs continue to grow and the technology to shift from AC to DC and
back becomes less expensive. Transformers within the substations are used to move the
voltage from one line or power plant up to or down to another voltage while maintaining
essentially the same level of power.
Distribution. Loads or end users of electricity (residences, commercial establishments,
and even most industry) require electrical power to be available in the voltages needed in
adequate supply when they need it. This often means in relatively small quantities at low
voltage and current. The size of the wires and switches in a typical house are able to be
quite small and of much lower cost because the power available to that house is restricted
to be relatively low. The electrical and electronic appliances similarly need only a small
amount of power to be available. Therefore, the high-voltage power of the transmission
system described previously is reduced (stepped down) through transformers and distributed
to the end users in levels they need and can use. Reactive load balancing equipment
is also part of the distribution system. This equipment is needed for system stability. The
electrical power system’s stability is finely tuned and fragile. Large-scale failures most
often occur because the system is destabilized by local anomalies.
The distinction between transmission and distribution is sometimes a fuzzy one because
it depends on the size and need of the load and the specific system involved. The distinction
is relevant for regulatory and business purposes. It does vary somewhat from region
to region. Traditionally distribution distances are under 20 miles and voltages are less
than 69.5 kV (more commonly 13.5 kV). However voltages up to 115 kV are used in
some locations. Distribution has substations just like transmission, only smaller. These
are not manned. Of importance is that the local switching, controls, and critical equipment
have become largely electronic with concomitant vulnerability to EMP.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
23
Alternating current, as opposed to direct current, is the medium for use of electricity as
a general matter. Electricity production, transmission, distribution, and use require a precise
frequency. Thus it is necessary across the vast electrical power system to precisely
and reliably synchronize the frequency and phase of power coming from different generating
sources and reaching and being utilized by different loads. Testimony to the accuracy
of this control has been the wide use and dependence on electric clocks and the
functioning of many electronic devices. The difficulty of maintaining the frequency synchronization
during off-normal conditions is usually a factor in large-scale power outages.
For example, when the frequency moves very far from a constant required level,
protective schemes at the generators within the transmission system and at the loads
alarm and often automatically trip. Occasionally these trip out of proper sequence causing
the system to compound rather than mitigate the problem, and the system collapses.
Control and Protection Systems. Overlaid on these three primary elements — generation,
transmission and distribution — is a control system that directs the power where it is
needed, maintains the frequency, and protects the system. Control is also necessary for
commercial aspects. The controls must protect the system from transients such as lightning,
correct synchronization errors by activating reactive sources or loads, isolate malfunctioning
elements of the grid, and prevent self-damage from improper compensation
or human error. The control systems also enable the deregulated energy marketplace by
tracking the origin, route, and destination of the energy commodity. Central to the monitoring
and coordination of the power grid is a broad class of devices called supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. These conform to an agreed set of standards
that make it possible to network many such systems over a generic communications
system, regardless of modality. SCADA devices are in broad use in a variety of applications
other than power.
The revolution in communication, information, system and component protection, and
control technologies has reached essentially every segment of the economy, and its heavy
impact on the electric power industry is no exception. The growing dependence of our
infrastructures on ubiquitous electronic control and protection systems confers great
benefits in terms of economic and operational efficiency, rapid diagnosis of problems,
and real-time remote control. At the same time and less often remarked, it also represents
a potential new vector of vulnerability that could be exploited by determined adversaries,
and intellectual efforts to mitigate such threats have been engaged. The infrastructure’s
vulnerability to EMP and other broad-impact events raises the threat to an entirely new
and vastly expanded plane of serious to catastrophic impacts.
Electronics have enabled electric power systems — generation, transmission, and distribution
— to achieve greater levels of efficiency and safety with much lower adverse
environmental impacts. Far less generation, transmission, and distribution are now necessary
to provide the same amount of benefit to the end user, thus significantly enhancing
productivity and overall quality of life. In doing so, however, the electrical system
operates closer to theoretical capacity and thus at narrower margins of safety and
reliability. Electronics have improved system economics and lowered the overall cost of
power to the end user while reducing pressure on basic resources and limiting potential
adverse impacts on the environment. This enhanced capability, both on the provider and
consumer side, is in part responsible (along with the regulatory environment) for the low
rate of investment in the high-value components of the electric system infrastructure. For
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power

example, slowly increasing electrical transmission demand has largely been met within
the limits of current production capacity for these components.
The continuing evolution of electronic devices into systems that once were exclusively
electromechanical, enabling computer control instead of direct human intervention and
use of broad networks like the Internet, results in ever greater reliance on microelectronics
and thus the present and sharply growing vulnerability of the power system to EMP
attack. Just as the computer networks have opened the possibility to cyber assault on the
power system or to electrical power system collapse associated with software failure (as
during the August 14, 2003, blackout), they have provided an opportunistic pathway for
EMP attack that is likely to be far more widespread, devastating, and difficult to assess
and restore. Switches, relays, and even generator exciters now have microprocessors and
analog-to-digital converters. These and other low-power electronics cannot be expected
to withstand EMP-generated stresses unless they are well protected. Protection must
encompass both device design and system integration. Even a well-designed system
installed without regard for EMP intrusion via connecting lines can be rendered inoperative
by EMP stress. There is a serious question regarding whether manual control of the
system sufficient to allow continued service will be possible even at a much-reduced state
in the aftermath of EMP.
The key vulnerable electronic systems are SCADA along with digital control systems
(DCS) and programmable logic controllers (PLC). SCADAs are used for data acquisition
and control over large and geographically distributed infrastructure systems while DCSs
and PLCs are used in localized applications. These systems all share similar electronic
components, generally representative of components that form the internal physical
architectures of portable computers. The different acronyms by which we presently identify
SCADA, DCS, and PLC should not obscure the fact that the electronics have evolved
to the point where the differing taxonomies are more representative of the functional differences
of the electronics equipment rather than differences in the electronics hardware
itself.
Electronic control equipment and innovative use of electronic controllers in equipment
that is not usually considered control equipment are rapidly replacing the purely electromechanical
systems and devices that were their predecessors. The use of such control
equipment is growing worldwide, and existing users are upgrading equipment as new
functionalities develop. The U.S. power industry alone is investing about $1.4 billion
annually in new SCADA equipment. This is perhaps 50 times the reinvestment rate in
transformers for transmission. The present rate represents upgrade and replacement of the
protection and control systems to ever more sophisticated microelectronics at roughly 25
to 30 percent annually, with each new component more susceptible to EMP than its
predecessor. The shift to greater electronic controls, computers, and the Internet also
results in fewer operators and different operator training. Thus the ability to operate the
system in the absence of such electronics and computer-driven actions is fast disappearing.
This is almost certain to have a highly deleterious effect on restoring service in the
event of an EMP attack.
Electrical System Organization
The integrated electrical power system of the United States and integrated systems in
Canada and Mexico are covered by the NERC. This vast network is broken into only
three truly separate systems at the present time — the Eastern Interconnection, the
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
25
Western Interconnection, and Texas. The dividing line geographically between the
Eastern and Western systems is roughly a line between Montana and North Dakota continuing
southward. The largest of these, the Eastern Interconnection, serves roughly 70
percent of the electrical load and population of the United States. The three regions are
separated electrically in AC in order to provide barriers for transfer of major frequency
deviations associated with system separations. This mode of operation between regions is
referred to as maintaining frequency independence. Importantly, this also acts as a barrier
to EMP-caused system disruption or any other major system disruption and consequent
collapse crossing between these three regions.
In figure 2-2 the map of the three NERC regions shows the divisions geographically
and the barriers for transfer of major frequency deviations associated with system separations.
There are some nonsynchronous connections, such as DC back-to-back converter
installations that facilitate limited power transfers yet maintain a barrier. The subregions
identified in the map within a region are for organizational, record keeping, and management
only. They do not have frequency independence from one another at this time.
Thus at present, whole regions can be caused to collapse by sufficiently large electrical
disturbances, like EMP, which severely exacerbates the problem of service to critical
loads and importantly impedes restoration where delay increases the adverse impacts
virtually exponentially.

Capacity Reserves
Although greater conservation and efficiency at the end user has reduced the need for
new generation largely through the use of improved electronics and controls, the growing
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
26
economy and use of ever greater labor- and material-saving devices continues to drive the
need for new generation. Furthermore, older generation is being replaced for economic,
environmental, and locational reasons. Increasing capital costs emanating from world
market competition and natural disasters, plus the increasing cost of capital, have slowed
the addition of new generation capacity. The inability in many cases to get generation to
market with reasonable assurance due to limited transmission has similarly limited new
generation additions. Finally, regulatory returns and pressure from competing uses of
capital within utility systems or their parents, including municipal and public systems,
have further restricted new generation of consequence. As a result, generation capacity
margins have decreased.
Changes in the regulatory environment with greater deregulation of the generating
sector have further encouraged recent increases in new generation capacity along with
retirement of older units. Most of the new power plants over the past decade or two have
been natural gas-fired units that are agile in their ability to adapt to market demands and
opportunities, are relatively clean environmentally for fossil plants, faster to build and
have lower capital cost than many alternative generator options. They have been located
farther from load in most instances than the older plants or previously planned additions,
and they are operated and integrated very differently than in the past as economic decisions
are often driven by very diverse and nonintegrated responsibility. This can stretch
the ability of the transmission system to get the new generation to load. The type and
location of new generation stresses the system and increases its vulnerability to various
threats including EMP.
The capacity margin (standby capacity for emergencies or other unplanned needs) for
the transmission system grid (system of higher voltage lines and substations) has
decreased from about 20 percent twenty years ago to about 10 percent now as an overall
system matter although there are considerable regional or local variations. This reduced
margin is due to little new construction, improved efficiency of the existing system, and
the location of new generation away from load. It is further exacerbated by the addition
of significant generation from renewable resources such as wind energy, which operates
when the wind blows, not when the electrical system might otherwise require power. This
results in shifting the generation between the wind and other controllable generation on
an unpredictable basis regardless of the transmission system reliability needs, all of
which results in greater and less predictable stresses on the overall system.
Operation of the transmission system at today’s reduced margin while maintaining
excellent reliability has been enabled by improved technology and operating practices for
protection, command, and control of the transmission grid. While power production and
consumption have grown, almost all of the growth has been absorbed on existing power
lines although new substations have been added. There has been very little construction
of transmission capacity, particularly of new longer distance transmission lines, or
renewal and replacement of existing infrastructure for many reasons, including deregulation
(discussed in the next section of this chapter). The transmission system thus is operating
with little ability to absorb adverse electrical impacts.
Overall, as a result of reduced generation capacity margins, the generation component
of the system is far less able to compensate for the difficulties that may be encountered
within the transmission system and vice versa. Together, the consequence is a power system
far more vulnerable to disruption than in the past, and this vulnerability is increasing.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
27
While greater protection and control schemes have still provided a very reliable system in
spite of this, the system is being stressed beyond reasonable limits. The electrical power
system has become virtually fully dependent upon electronic systems working nearly
flawlessly. The overall system reliability is testimony to the skill and effectiveness of the
control systems. However, the lack of margin (combination of generation and transmission
margins) results in making catastrophic cascading outages far more likely, and
should the electronics be disrupted, the system is highly likely to fail on a broad scale.
Thus, the small margin and reliance on electronics give rise to EMP vulnerability.
High-value assets (assets that are critical to the production and delivery of large volumes
of electrical power and those critical for service to key loads) in the system are vulnerable
to EMP through the loss of protection equipment due to E1 and even if E3 levels
were not large enough to cause damage. The largest and most critical of these are
transformers. Transformers are the critical link (1) between generation and transmission,
(2) within the transmission network, (3) between the transmission and distribution
systems, and (4) from the distribution to the load.
The transformers that handle electrical power within the transmission system and its
interfaces with the generation and distribution systems are large, expensive, and to a considerable
extent, custom built. The transmission system is far less standardized than the
power plants are, which themselves are somewhat unique from one to another. All production
for these large transformers used in the United States is currently offshore.
Delivery time for these items under benign circumstances is typically one to two years.
There are about 2,000 such transformers rated at or above 345 kV in the United States
with about 1 percent per year being replaced due to failure or by the addition of new
ones. Worldwide production capacity is less than 100 units per year and serves a world
market, one that is growing at a rapid rate in such countries as China and India. Delivery
of a new large transformer ordered today is nearly 3 years, including both manufacturing
and transportation. An event damaging several of these transformers at once means it
may extend the delivery times to well beyond current time frames as production is taxed.
The resulting impact on timing for restoration can be devastating. Lack of high voltage
equipment manufacturing capacity represents a glaring weakness in our survival and
recovery to the extent these transformers are vulnerable. Distribution capability is
roughly in the same condition although current delivery times are much less (i.e., limited
manufacturing capability, although there is domestic production).
Deregulation
At least a decade ago, the power systems were owned and operated by vertically integrated
utility companies. These entities consisted of investor-owned (owned by shareholders,
commonly referred to as private) utilities, utilities that are government constructs
(federal, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, Bonneville Power Administration, and
others), consumer-owned cooperatives, municipalities, and entities of the state such as
peoples and public utility districts. The different entities were granted monopoly powers
for service and were regulated through a variety of mechanisms including self-regulation
for some of the government entities. In any given service territory, the local utility owned
the generation, transmission, and distribution and was responsible for adequate supply,
reliability, and other aspects of service quality.
This situation has changed. On April 24, 1996, FERC issued Orders 888 and 889,
which encouraged wholesale power supply competition, deregulating this single aspect of
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
28
the electrical industry. This allowed any party to produce and sell power to any other
party at the wholesale levels (meaning sales to utility or load-serving entities, as opposed
to direct retail sales to end users). Existing generation by investor-owned utilities was
forced to be divested in many circumstances. This regulation applied only to the investorowned
utilities comprising a bit more than half the total U.S. electrical load. Many governmental
or public entities did not possess generation of their own, and some that did
followed by example and market imperatives. In some instances states have carried the
deregulation further to a variety of forms of competition at the retail level.
The transmission infrastructure has remained regulated, and the previous vertically
integrated systems in many instances were not allowed to commercially control their
transmission in order to free up competition at the wholesale levels. Due to the
complexity of an open market using an infrastructure that was built for another operating
environment, the requirements for investment in the transmission system have been
uncertain and more expensive. FERC regulates the transmission facilities in terms of use
and pricing, but not location. The federal transmission regulation paradigm is moving
toward being market based, which will have unknown impacts but is believed to assist in
the development of new transmission facilities. The states also play an important role in
the regulation of transmission and generation that is not consistent from state to state.
With the market (and the market model itself) in flux, there is unwillingness presently to
invest in transmission infrastructure.
There is no incentive for the states or localities to accede to construction of lines that
are to move power over or through the state or locality without direct benefit to such state
or locality. The power going through the lines pays no fees and no taxes to the hosts,
although there are minor property taxes on the physical facilities in some instances. Until
recently there was no capability to track the path of a given unit of energy when operating
in AC and even then it is more calculation via model-specific than actual measurement.
This is because AC power travels over the path of least resistance not as the flow of
power might be contracted. Thus while a new interconnected line may appear to carry
power pursuant to a contract for delivery between two parties, it is unlikely that the
power will flow physically as envisioned. Thus it is unclear who will pay for the use of
the new line. While new capability to track AC power (E-tags) could provide the basis for
fiscal incentives for new line construction, it is not yet widely deployed nor well understood
or accepted. Moreover, regulatory requirements create impediments to new line
construction even if the incentives and capital are at hand. In short, from a business perspective,
transmission lines are often low return or loss centers in the current
environment.
The end state of the regulatory paradigm is still undetermined, and this uncertainty
coupled with lack of local benefits when passing through state and local areas all contribute
to the diminishing transmission capacity margins. There is uncertainty whether, by
the time construction of new lines is completed, the investment could be recovered. It is
likely that this situation will persist until the market model is clarified and implemented,
which may take several years given the complexity and number of competing interests,
including between the states and the Federal Government as well as with neighboring
states. The market and system reliability pressure may move this faster as recognition and
evidence mount. As noted earlier, the reduced and diminishing margins contribute significantly
to EMP vulnerability.

Vulnerabilities
In order to assess the nature of EMP effects on the electrical system, we separately
analyzed the potential effects of an electromagnetic pulse on each of the three main constituents
of the power system — generation, transmission, and distribution. Within the
context of a principal finding of the NERC EMP task force, recovery following an EMPcaused
outage within any reasonably acceptable time is contingent largely on preventing
damage to the high-value assets (assets that are critical to the production and delivery of
large volumes of electrical power and those critical for service to key loads) and identifying
and replacing ones that become damaged. Therefore, the Commission focused on
identifying what those high value assets might be and their susceptibility to EMP damage.
Thus, proper design, installation, and functioning of the protective equipment for
these assets during an EMP attack are critical. There are other critical aspects to recovery
that are discussed subsequently.
Generation
A power plant is designed to protect itself in the event of instantaneous loss of load,
electrical faults or trips on the interconnected transmission system or internally, frequency
excursions beyond rather tight limits, and often for the loss of an external power
source for proper shutdown. None of these conditions should damage a power plant if the
protective systems function properly, as frequently has been demonstrated. Very little
damage to generation has occurred in previous blackouts, including the August 14, 2003,
blackout. However, some malfunctioning in the multiple controls throughout a power
plant does occur, albeit rarely. Therefore, on a broad enough scale, as in an EMP attack
affecting many power plants at once, damage to a small number of these power plants
would be expected statistically. Since E2 and E3 are not assessed as direct threats to the
generation system (except for their step-up transformers and associated breakers), the
critical vulnerability question is E1-induced plant control system failure.
The E1 pulse can upset the protection and control system, including damaging control
and protective system components, and cause the plant to trip or trigger emergency controlled
shut down. Current, temperature, pressure, frequency, and other physical parameters
are monitored by the control systems. These provide independent measurements of
same system, and all can cause the plant to trip off line and go to controlled shut down.
Given the redundancy of protective system design, either several protective devices or
devices in the critical path would have to fail in order for the plant not to initiate protective
shutdown. However, if the control system itself or secondary nodal controls and
receivers critical to orderly shut down are themselves damaged, as is reasonably possible
with E1, then the plant is seriously at risk. Power plants, particularly newer ones, are
highly sophisticated, very high-speed machines, and improper shut down can damage or
destroy any of the many critical components and can even cause a catastrophic failure.
Nuclear plants are an exception due to the nature of their protection schemes.
Given the range of potential E1 levels, analysis and test results provide a basis to expect
sufficient upset to cause a plant’s system to shut down improperly in many cases. Proper
shutdown depends on synchronized operation of multiple controllers and switches. For
example: coal intake and exhaust turbines must operate together or else explosion or
implosion of the furnace may occur. Cooling systems must respond properly to temperature
changes during shut down or thermal gradients can cause boiler deformation or rupture.
Orderly spin-down of the turbine is required to avoid shaft sagging and blades
impacting the casings. Bearings can easily fail and freeze or damage the shaft if the shut

Chapter 2. Electric Power
30
down does not engage emergency lubrication. There are similar issues inside very complex
machines operating at high temperatures at fast speeds with tight tolerances. Thus,
power plant survivability depends on a great many protective systems creating multiple
pathways to plant damage and failure.
Restoration of some damage can be very long term, certainly months and in some
instances years. The loss of generation of any size itself would contribute to systemwide
collapse and certainly would limit restoration. Manufacturers of generation plant protection
and control equipment performed some limited evaluation and while there are layers
of redundancy, as noted, more and more these systems are going to computer-controlled
microelectronics, and thus are more susceptible to EMP disruption.
At the device level, power plant protective systems are less exposed than the corresponding
systems in the transmission grid. They act on local information, so failure of
telecommunications systems is not as much of an issue for plant protection where operators
are available in most instances 24/7 and can independently assess the situation and
act. The control equipment, protective systems, sensors, and current transformers typically
(but by no means always) will be inside the plant although this does not necessarily
mean they will not be exposed. In general there will be no outside cable runs, so the
building itself will provide some EMP protection. However the lengths of these interior
cables can be on the order of 100 meters. Cable trays may or may not provide additional
protection, depending on their material and installation method. The key is not device- or
component-level testing for EMP susceptibility but overall control and protective system
test to evaluate vulnerability. Subjecting an entire sophisticated and modern power plant
to testing is not feasible. However, it does not take many damaged plants out of the many
hundreds to seriously impact the system operation and the ability to restore service. The
fact that all power plants exposed to E1 EMP will be illuminated simultaneously (within
one power cycle) makes the situation extremely serious.
System Restoration — Generation
The restoration of the system from collapse is very complex in operation, almost an art
rather than a science, and it requires highly trained and experienced operators with considerable
information and controls at hand. Basically, in isolated cases or when beginning
restoration, a load and generation source has to be identified and interconnected without
interference from other loads or generation. These are then matched and gradually
restored together. Thereafter, each increment of generation and load is added in turn to a
larger operating system of generation and load. As each component of load and generation
are included, the frequency will be impacted. If it varies outside very tight limits, it
will all trip off and have to be put back together again. In most system disruptions leading
to blackouts, there are large amounts of system still intact on the periphery of the disruption,
which are able to greatly assist in the restoration, more easily allowing and absorbing
each addition of generation and load until all is restored.
Every generator requires a load to match its electrical output as every load requires
electricity. In the case of the generator, it needs load so it does not overspin and fail, yet
not so much load it cannot function. In a large integrated system, where increments of
load and generation are not sufficient to cause the frequency to drop or rise above acceptable
margins, it is relatively straightforward and commonplace, just as turning on a
lightswitch causes a generator someplace to pick up the load. In the case where the sysCRITICAL
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
31
tem is being restored and there are few loads and generators connected, this matching
requires careful management and communication between load and generation.
Generation start-up for most plants requires power from another source to drive pumps,
fans, safety systems, fuel delivery, and so on. Some, like hydroelectric and smaller diesels
can start directly or from battery sources assuming they can control their access to
matching load. In the case of EMP, large geographic areas of the electrical system will be
down, and there may be no existing system operating on the periphery for the generation
and loads to be incrementally added with ease. Furthermore, recovery of lost generation
would be impacted by the loss of other infrastructure in varying degrees according to the
type of plant. In that instance, it is necessary to have a “black start”: a start without external
power source. Coal plants, nuclear plants, large gas- and oil-fired plants, geothermal
plants, and some others all require power from another source to restart. In general,
nuclear plants are not allowed to restart until and unless there are independent sources of
power from the interconnected transmission grid to provide for independent shutdown
power. This is a regulatory requirement for protection rather than a physical impediment.
What might be the case in an emergency situation is for the Government to decide at the
time.
Black-start generation is that kind of generator that is independent of outside power
sources to get started, hence the term black start. Most black start units today are
hydroelectric plants, small gas peaking units, small oil-fired peaking units and diesel
units. In some cases the black start unit may be collocated with a larger power plant in
order to get the larger one started for system restoration. Fuel supply would then be the
only issue from the generation perspective; for example, a gas plant might not have the
fuel due to EMP damage someplace in the delivery system. Assuming the black start
units were not damaged by EMP or have been repaired and assuming they are large
enough to be significant, workers can begin the system restoration as building blocks
from the generation side of the equation. E1 may have also damaged their startup electronics,
which will need to be repaired first. It is often the case that generation capable of
black start is not manned, so if they fail to start remotely, a person will need to be dispatched
to find the problem, locate the needed parts, and get it operating. There are not
many black start-capable units in locations that are suitable to independent restoration at
this time. Recovery in most regions therefore needs to wait for other areas to restore
power and then be reconnected increment by increment.
Even if partially disabled control systems successfully protect the critical generating
equipment, all affected plants would face a long process of testing and repairing control,
protective, and sensor systems. Protective and safety systems have to be carefully
checked out before start up or greater loss might occur. Repair of furnaces, boilers, turbines,
blades, bearings, and other heavy high-value and long lead-time equipment would
be limited by production and transportation availability once at-site spares are exhausted.
While some spare components are at each site and sometimes in spare parts pools
domestically, these would not cover very large high-value items in most cases, so external
sources would be needed. Often supply from an external source can take many weeks
or several months in the best of times, if only one plant is seeking repair, and sometimes
a year or more. With multiple plants affected at the same time, let alone considering
infrastructure impediments, restoration time would certainly become protracted.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
32
Transmission
Most generation is located outside major population areas and thus sometimes at great
distances from the load being served. In general, electricity often travels great distances
on an efficient high-voltage transmission system. The transmission system is made up of
different owners, voltage levels, and controls. Yet power must be routed to where it is
needed, so there are nodes called substations where the power lines join and are switched,
and where power is moved from one voltage level to another level, interconnected with
other transmission system components, and sent on to distribution systems. Finally as it
gets closer to load, power is stepped down (reduced in voltage) and then down again and
often down yet again to and within the distribution system and then normally down again
to the delivery point for the load. Each of those step-down points requires a transformer
to effect the change and breakers to isolate the transformer when necessary.
In the event of the loss of a generation facility, a fully functional transmission system
can move the remaining generation from whatever plants can operate to areas otherwise
affected by loss of a particular generating station. This occurs in normal practice as generation
plants are brought in and out of service for one reason or another. The same thing
happens when part of the transmission system is down for whatever reason. Other transmission
in the network picks up the loss and generation is shifted so that the loads can
continue to be served. All this is accomplished regularly as part of system operation. The
ability to adjust quickly given access to a multitude of resources, generation, and transmission
makes the system reliable. Incapacitation of sufficient elements of the transmission
system would mean the inability to deliver power whether the generation is available
or not. The same inability would be true for incapacitation of sufficient generation. In the
case of EMP, both would be likely to be impacted simultaneously. This is what results in
a blackout where the load does not get served. The transmission system is highly vulnerable
to EMP.
Substation control systems at the nodes or hubs in the transmission system are inherently
more exposed to the E1 pulse than their power plant counterparts, which are often
not in buildings at all. The sensors, communications, and power connections are outdoors
and cables (i.e., antennas in the sense of an EMP receptor) which may be hundreds of
meters long may be buried, run along the ground, or elevated. The control devices themselves,
including the protective relays, may even be in remote structures that provide little
electromagnetic attenuation. Most substations do not have operators present but are
remotely controlled from power dispatch centers, in some instances hundreds of miles
away.
Operation of transmission substations depends on various communications modalities,
including telephone, microwave, power line communications, cell phones, satellite
phones, the Internet, and others. Typically, these modes are used for dedicated purposes;
they do not necessarily provide a multiple redundant system but are “stove piped.” From
the point of view of managing routine system perturbations and preventing their propagation,
NERC advises us that the telephone remains the most important mode. If the
voice communications were completely interrupted, it would be difficult, but still reasonably
possible, to successfully continue operations — provided there were no significant
system disruptions. However in the case of an EMP event with multiple simultaneous
disruptions, continued operation is not possible. Restoration without some form of
communication is also not possible. Communication is clearly critical in the path to
restoration.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
33
Just as in the case involving power plants, the first critical issue is the proper functioning
of the protective elements, specifically relays, followed by the local control systems.
These elements protect the high-voltage breakers and transformers that are high-value
assets. High-value assets are those that are critical to system functioning and take a very
long time to replace or repair. Other protected devices, such as capacitors and reactive
power generators, are also high value and nearly as critical as the transformers. E1 is
likely to disrupt and perhaps damage protective relays, not uniformly but in statistically
very significant numbers. Left unprotected, as would likely result from E1 damage or
degradation to the protective relays, the high-value assets would likely suffer damage by
the transient currents produced during the system collapse, as well as potentially from E2
and E3 depending upon relative magnitudes. Commission testing of some typical
protective relays with lower than expected EMP levels provides cause for serious
concern.
The high-value transmission equipment is
subject to potentially large stress from the E3
pulse. The E3 pulse is not a freely propagating
wave like E1 and E2, but the result of distortions
in the Earth’s magnetic field caused by the upper
atmosphere nuclear explosion. The distortion
couples very efficiently to long transmission
lines and induces quasi-direct current electrical
currents to flow. The currents in these long lines
can aggregate to become very large (minute-long
ground-induced currents [GIC] of hundreds to
thousands of amperes) sufficient to damage
major electrical power system components. With respect to transformers, probably the
hardest to replace quickly, this quasi-direct current, carried by all three phases on the
primary windings of the transformer, drives the transformer to saturation, creating harmonics
and reactive power. The harmonics cause transformer case heating and over-currents
in capacitors potentially resulting in fires. The reactive power flow would add to the
stresses on the grid if it were not already in a state of collapse. Historically, we know that
geomagnetic storms, which can induce GIC flows similar to but less intense than those
likely to be produced by E3, have caused transformer and capacitor damage even on
properly protected equipment (see figure 2-3). Damage would be highly likely on
equipment unprotected or partially protected due to E1.
The likelihood and scope of the E3 problem are exacerbated by the small transmission
margins currently available. The closer a transformer is operating to its performance
limit, the smaller the GIC needed to cause failure. Moreover, newer transmission substations
are increasingly using three single-phase transformers to handle higher power transfer,
since the equivalently rated three-phase transformers are too large to ship. The threephase
systems are more resistant to GIC, since their design presumes a balanced threephase
operation. Thus the separate single-phase transformers are more susceptible to
damage from GIC.
System Restoration — Transmission
The transmission system is the lynch pin between generation and load. It is also a network
interconnecting numerous individual loads and generating sources. To restore the
overall power system to get generation to load, as noted earlier, an increment of genera-

1989 Geomagnetic Storm

Chapter 2. Electric Power
34
tion needs to be matched to an increment of load and then add the next matching increments
and so on. As the number of increments becomes greater, there is some flex in the
system to absorb variations. As a result, the restoration is easier and goes much faster. In
the initial increments however, the transmission system link between generation and load
has to be isolated so other loads, which may well remain connected, do not impact the
effort. This is tricky and requires careful coordination to adjust the breakers in the substations
so the link is routed correctly and safely.
The power transmission grid is designed to break into islands of hopefully matched
generation and load when the system receives a sufficient electrical disruption. This is
both to protect service in the nonimpacted regions and to allow for the stable systems to
be used to restart the island that lost functionality. With EMP, broad geographic reach
and simultaneous multiple levels of disruption result in a situation in which the islanding
schemes themselves will probably fail to work in the EMP-affected area. Since the geographic
area is so large, perhaps encompassing an entire NERC region or possibly more,
restoring the system from the still functioning perimeter may well not be possible at all or
would take a great deal of time; the Commission estimates weeks to months, at least in
the best circumstance.
Distribution
Most of the long power outages that Americans have experienced were due to physical
damage to the distribution system — local damage. This damage is usually caused by
natural events such as weather. Windblown trees fall on neighborhood power lines or ice
buildup drops lines that in some instances make contact with live lines causing arcs that
in turn can even result in distribution transformers exploding.
EMP damage to the distribution system would be less dramatic than that inflicted upon
the transmission system but still would result in loss of load. The principal effect of EMP
would be E1-induced arcing across the insulators that separate the power lines from the
supporting wood or metal poles. The arcing can damage the insulator itself and in some
cases result in pole-mounted transformer explosions. Damage to large numbers of insulators
and pole-mounted transformers could also result in a shortage of replacement parts,
as these items are fairly reliable under normal conditions, and spares are not kept to cover
widespread losses. Ultimately workarounds and replacements can be found in most circumstances
although widespread damage and impact to related infrastructures will cause
delay.
The important effect of the loss of load in the EMP scenario is that it happens simultaneously.
Thus it represents a substantial upset to the entire grid, causing the frequency to
spin up and protective relays to open on generation and can by itself result in a cascading
failure and blackout of the entire NERC region. Similarly, any consumer or industrial
electrical device that is shut down or damaged by EMP contributes to the load loss and
further drives the system to collapse. It becomes a case of what comes first to cause what
failure since the EMP E1 impulse is virtually simultaneously disrupting all facets of the
electrical system and load.
Synergistic Effects of E1, E2, and E3
The effects of EMP on the electrical power system are fundamentally partitioned into
its early, middle, and late time effects (caused by the E1, E2, and E3 components,
respectively). The net impact on the electric power grid includes the synergistic interaction
of all three, occurring nearly simultaneously over a large geographic area. The
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
35
Commission has concluded that the electrical system within the NERC region so disrupted
will collapse with near certainty. Thus one or more of the three integrated, frequency-
independent NERC regions will be without electrical service. This loss is very
large geographically and restoration is very likely to be beyond short-term emergency
backup generators and batteries. Any reasonable EMP event would be much larger than
the Texas region so basically the concern is the Eastern and Western regions with Texas
either included or not depending upon the location of the weapon. The basic threat to
U.S. society that moves an EMP event from a local or short-term adverse impact to a
more prolonged and injurious event is the time it takes to restore electrical and other
infrastructure service.
The early time EMP, or E1, is a freely propagating field with a rise time in the range of
less than one to a few nanoseconds. E1 damages or disrupts electronics such as the
SCADA, DCS, and PLC as well as communications and to some extent transportation
(necessary for supplies and personnel). This disrupts control systems, sensors, communication
systems, protective systems, generator systems, fuel systems, environmental mitigation
systems and their related computers, as well as the ability to repair. SCADA components,
in particular, are frequently situated in remote environments and operate without
proximate human intervention. While their critical electronic elements are usually contained
within some sort of metallic box, the enclosures’ service as a protective Faraday
cage is inadequate. Such metallic containers are designed only to provide protection from
the weather and a modicum of physical security. They are not designed to protect the
electronics from high-energy electromagnetic pulses, which may infiltrate either from the
free field or from the many antennae (cable connections) that compromise electromagnetic
integrity.
The E1 pulse also causes flashovers in the lower voltage distribution system, resulting
in immediate broad geographic scale loss of electrical load and requiring line or insulator
replacement for restoration.
The intermediate time EMP, or E2, is similar in frequency regime to lightning, but
vastly more widespread, like thousands to millions of simultaneous lightning strikes,
even if each strike is at lower amplitude than most naturally occurring lightning. The
electrical power system has existing protective measures for lightning, which are probably
adequate. However, the impact of this many simultaneous lightning-like strike disruptions
over an extremely large geographic area may exceed those protections. The most
significant risk, however, is synergistic because the E2 pulse follows on the heels of the
E1. Thus where E1-induced damage has circumvented lightning protection, the E2
impact could pass directly into major system components and damage them.
The late time EMP, or E3, follows E1 and E2 and may last for a minute or more. The
E3 pulse is similar in a great many respects to geomagnetic effects induced by solar
storms. Solar storms and their impacts on electrical systems with long lines have been
thoroughly evaluated and are known to cause serious damage to major electrical system
components at much lower levels than the reasonably possible E3 impact. This damage
has been incurred in spite of functioning, in-place protective systems. Given the preceding
E1 and E2 pulse damage to the protective systems and other system components,
damage from E3 to unprotected major system components is virtually assured.
EMP is inimical to the continued functioning of the electrical power system and the
reliable behavior of electronics. Each of the three EMP modes of system insult is suffiCRITICAL
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
36
cient by itself to cause disruption and probable functional collapse of large portions of the
interconnected electrical power system at EMP threat levels. In every EMP attack, all
three assaults (E1, E2, and E3) are delivered in sequence and nearly simultaneously. It is
the Commission’s assessment that functional collapse of the electrical power system
region within the primary area of assault is virtually certain. Furthermore, widespread
functional collapse may result even from a small weapon with a significant E1 component.
While stopping electrical supply over a broad geographical area nearly instantaneously
is damaging, it is the time it takes to restore service that is important, assuming
restoration is possible, which itself may be questioned in some instances.
System Collapse Scenarios
NERC was one of several key advisers on the EMP impact assessment discussed above
although the conclusions and emphasis are the Commission’s alone. NERC also informed
the Commission that there is no modeling capability extant, either deterministic or statistical,
that can assess with confidence the outcome of simultaneous, combined subsystem
failures. Putting together a coherent picture of the projected system collapse scenario
must rely on expert judgment.
Large-scale load losses in excess of 10 percent are likely at EMP threat levels. Instantaneous
unanticipated loss of load, by itself, can cause system collapse. This is possible at
1 percent loss, and is very likely above 10 percent. At similar percentage levels, loss of
generation can also cause system collapse. Both the load loss (normally from a transmission
system failure) and generation loss resulting in system collapse have been experienced.
At the levels of loss for each, collapse is highly likely if not certain. Systemwide
ground-induced currents in the transmission grid can by themselves cause system collapse.
They did so in March 1989 in Quebec. At the levels expected in an E3 event, collapse
would be much more likely and widespread.
Loss of computer control of substation switchyard equipment could, by itself, lead to
system collapse. Manual operation is possible only with adequate communication and the
ability of personnel to physically get to the right substations, a problematic question in
the event of an EMP attack. Adequate numbers of trained and experienced personnel will
be a serious problem even if they could all be contacted and could make themselves
available. Thus manual operation would be necessary and might not be timely enough or
have sufficient skilled personnel to deal with a broad-scale, instantaneous disruption and
dynamic situation. Loss of manual control of switchyard equipment would, in short order,
lead to line and transformer faults and trips. Several substations tripping nearly simultaneously
would lead itself to system collapse.
Loss of telecommunications would not, by itself, cause immediate system collapse
except as needed to address issues caused by the above disruptions. However the lack of
telemetered control data would make the system operators effectively blind to what is
going on, but personnel at substations, if they can get there and communicate with the
system operators, could overcome much of that. Malfunction of protective relays could
cause system collapse by contributing to several of the above scenarios through misinformation
or by operating incorrectly.
All of these collapse mechanisms acting simultaneously provide the unambiguous conclusion
that electrical power system collapse for the NERC region largely impacted by
the EMP weapon is inevitable in the event of attack using even a relatively low-yield
device of particular characteristics.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power

Damage Scenarios
The level of damage depends primarily on the functioning of the protective equipment,
but it also depends on various aspects of the collapse. In an EMP event, the collapse is
virtually instantaneous. The size of the transients on the system may be greater than
existing protective systems are capable of handling, even those not damaged by the EMP
itself.
Damage to the large transformers and other high-value equipment is directly related to
protective relay failure, although it is possible for E1-induced arcs inside transformers to
damage transformers irrespective of relay failure. In general, since sequential shutdown is
not required, one device per relay is a reasonable rule of thumb. A properly functioning
relay has a reasonable chance of protecting the device; an improperly functioning one
will probably result in some level of damage in an ensuing system collapse. The level of
damage depends on the failure mode. The Commission-sponsored tests were focused on
determining the thresholds for damage. EMP threat levels are expected to exceed these
thresholds.
Test Results
The EMP Commission conducted both free-field and cable current injection simulation
testing. The Commission took the basic stance in its testing program that testing would
determine the thresholds at which substantial failure rates (either temporary or permanent)
commenced to appear. These, in turn, were used to index attack severities at which
the corresponding U.S. infrastructures would be seriously compromised or failed. The
Commission’s test experience — massively supplemented by that of other U.S. Government
operations — was that failure rates typically increased rapidly with peak field
amplitude, once a threshold had been attained at which failure or disruption appeared at
all. The rationale for such threshold determining testing was that abrupt and synchronized
loss of only a few percent of items such as electric power system relays would have grave
impacts on the functionality of the system containing such items. This is much like the
effect that a few percent of vehicles on a freeway that become disabled would have, producing
a serious deleterious impact on the flow of traffic.
A crude rule of thumb was that roughly a factor-of-ten increase in damage effects might
be expected when the peak field amplitude was doubled; the exact scaling relation naturally
varied from one device type to another and also had very substantial dependence on
the frequency content of the pulse, which however, the Commission testing program
explored only slightly.
Based on the testing and analysis outlined in this chapter, we estimate that a substantial
and highly significant fraction of all control and protective systems within the EMPaffected
area will experience some type of impact. As the test results were briefed to
industry experts at NERC and the Argonne National Laboratory, it became apparent to
the Commission that even minor effects noted during the testing could have significant
impacts on the processes and equipment being controlled.
Free-Field Testing
EMP free-field simulation testing was conducted using a bounded wave simulator (see
figure 2-4). The testing was conducted in three phases.
Phase I was dedicated to evaluating the so-called transfer response for the various test
systems. This is a measure of the coupling strength of the external perturbation to the test
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
38
system and provides insight into the expected fraction of the energy in an EMP field that
may be deposited into the exposed electronic device. Induced current transients were
measured on all the accessible cables of the control systems and measurements were
made at the lowest field levels produced by the simulator to minimize the electrical stress
on the exposed equipment. Phases II and III of the testing program were focused on
obtaining data on fragilities, that is, on identifying the thresholds for induced malfunction
or damage response in the tested equipment. A total of eight steps were selected that
Figure 2-4. EMP Simulator
gradually increased the electrical stress on the control systems. During this testing, all
systems were operational with diagnostics and checkouts run at the conclusion of each
simulated EMP exposure.
The simulation testing provided an opportunity to observe the interaction of the electromagnetic
energy with equipment in an operational mode. Observed effects can be
related to the system response in more realistic scenarios through analysis based on coupling
differences between the simulated and real-world cases. Since the simulation is not
perfect — the pulse length is too long and the test volume too small to capture the longer
cable run couplings to be found in a real environment — post test analysis and engineering
judgment is required to relate the test results to expected SCADA vulnerabilities in a
true EMP event.
There is also no pretense that any test program could possibly do more than selectively
sample the wide variety of installed SCADA systems. The choice of representative test
systems was guided by findings from previous infrastructure site surveys, by solicited
recommendations from industry groups such as the NERC, and by conducting a review of
several market surveys.
In the end, four separate control systems were acquired for testing. These systems were
representative of those found in power transmission, distribution, power generation, and
oil and gas distribution for fueling power plants.
A key observation from this test program is that a wide variety of SCADA, DCS, and
PLC malfunctions resulted when exposed to simulated threshold level EMP environments.
These ranged from electronic upset of equipment, which might be repaired by
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
39
either reboot or recycle to physical damage that required the actual replacement of the
affected hardware.
The response of the control systems tested varied from system to system as well as
from subsystem to subsystem. For example, a unit consisting of multiple input/output
ports (or subsystems) connected to a variety of field or communications devices had
some ports experience upsets, some experience physical damage, and some experience no
effect, all in the same simulation event.
As an example, at relatively low electromagnetic stress levels, a portion of a DCS process
controller provided false indications of the process status. An operator interface indicated
a switch was on when in actuality it had been turned off, while internal voltage and
temperature were reported as out of their normal operating ranges when they were actually
normal. These effects were significant because they occurred most frequently on
control systems used in SCADA applications, which are geographically dispersed. Correcting
these malfunctions typically had to be performed manually at the device location.
This approach would greatly complicate the recovery process for geographically distributed
systems.
In addition to false readings from the sensors, direct malfunctions of some tested control
elements were also noted. Additional control element effects included the failure of
pressure transmitters, which included both physical damage and loss of calibration data
required to indicate proper readings.
Control systems often rely on Ethernet for communications to the man-machine interface
as well as communications between controllers in dispersed systems. Communications
systems based on Ethernet components similar to those found in PC networking
systems suffered substantial degradation and damage effects when illuminated by the
simulated albeit low-level EMP pulse. These damage effects are significant since they
require the systems to be physically repaired or replaced in order to restore the normal
communications capabilities.
Many of the effects noted in the previous paragraphs are attributed to the coupling to
the wires and cables interconnecting the systems. The level of this coupling scales
roughly with the length of the wire. As a general rule, the larger the transients are in the
coupling lines, the more damaging they are to electronics equipment. It is therefore
important to consider the transients that might be induced if a more distributed system
encounters the same EMP electromagnetic energy. One way to address this concern is to
perform cable coupling analysis. This was done as part of the current injection test program
in order to relate the susceptibility levels of electronic equipment to the EMP threat.
At the system level, 100 percent of the control systems were affected at times. This is
highly relevant to the prospect of system collapse and scope of the problem of restoration.
This is more difficult to quantify at the subsystem level due to the sheer number of
subsystems associated with each system. Translation to real world conditions must be
tempered in cases where the control systems are located in structures that provide electromagnetic
shielding of the incident EMP energy, but few of these exist in practice.
Current Injection Testing
Current injection testing was typically done by introducing transient voltage waveforms
on a cable leading to the equipment under test. Depending on its load and that of the test
generator, current was delivered to the test object. All of the electronics found in the
power system is developed using a national (ANSI/IEEE) or international (IEC) standard
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
40
for a series of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) waveforms that are representative of
the transients observed during normal operation. One waveform that is commonly tested
is known as the electrical fast transient (EFT). It has a rise time of 5 ns and a pulse width
of 50 ns. By coincidence, this is very similar to the type of waveform coupled to cables
by E1.
The objective of this testing was to determine at what level each type of equipment fails
to operate normally and also to determine when operator intervention is necessary for the
equipment to operate normally. Most of the equipment tested had multiple cable connections,
covering different functions (power, signal, communications, etc.). These were all
tested.
Given the levels of voltage in which the equipment malfunctioned, a separate effort was
performed to compute the coupling of the incident E1 to cables with various lengths and
orientations. For the long, exposed cables found in transmission substations, it was found
that the induced voltage could exceed 20 kV under many circumstances.
In addition to free-field testing, the Commission sponsored a current injection testing
program. The test program was representative in the sense that exemplars of most functional
components were tested. Due to expense and time constraints, typically only one or
two vendors’ equipment was tested, and only one or two samples of a type were tested.
The types of equipment tested and results brief are described in the following paragraphs:
Electro-mechanical relays. These are the old-fashioned devices that contain no integrated
circuits but function using high-power relays. They are still used in about 50 percent
of applications, but that share is continuing to decline. As expected, these are
immune to EMP upset up to the highest levels tested.
Distribution line insulators. Earlier studies have indicated low vulnerability for these
simple devices. The Commission-sponsored tests on a variety of 15kV class pin and suspension
insulators indicate that there is a higher vulnerability than previously thought
New tests performed with the power on found that some insulators were destroyed due to
the current following the path of the E1-induced arc. Statistical testing was not performed,
so it is not clear what percentage of insulators will behave in this fashion; however,
it is clear that power-on testing should be performed in the future to better understand
this effect.
Electronic protective relays. These devices (see
figure 2-5) are the essential elements preserving
high-value transmission equipment from damage
during geomagnetic storms and other modes of grid
collapse. Fortunately, these test items were the most
robust of any of the electronic devices tested. However,
test agencies reported that they are subject to upset at higher levels of simulated
EMP exposure. We believe that altering the deployment configurations can further ameliorate
the residual problems.

Programmable logic controllers and digital
control systems. These units are most
commonly found in industrial settings and in
particular are extensively used in power
plants. They are subject to upset and damage
at moderate levels of EMP assault (see figure
2-6). The circuit board pictured is from a
typical PLC unit and is exhibiting a damaging
short-circuit flashover during EMP
Commission-sponsored testing.
General-purpose desktop computers and
SCADA remote and master terminal units.
These were the most susceptible to damage
or upset of all the test articles. Unlike the
other kinds of devices tested, several different models and vintages were examined. The
RS-232 ports were found to be particularly susceptible, even at very low levels of EMP
stress.
With the exception of the RS-232 connections, all of the electronic devices that were
tested performed up to the manufacturer’s claimed levels for electromagnetic compatibility.
Thus, the international standards to which the manufacturers subscribe are being met.
Unfortunately the induced E1 stress is higher than the standards for normal operation.
The net result of this testing provides evidence that the power grid is also vulnerable to
collapse due to the E1 component of an EMP assault, primarily through the upset and
damage of the soft computer systems that are in common use. This however suggests that
operational performance can be considerably enhanced at modest cost by attending to
installation and configuration issues.
Historical Insights
To provide insight into the potential impact of EMP-induced electronic system malfunctions,
the Commission evaluated previous large service failure events. In these cases,
similar (and less severe) system malfunctions have produced consequences in situations
that were far too complex to predict using a model or analysis.
Another important observation is that these situations are seldom the result of a single
factor but rather a combination of unexpected events, which are easily related to the
impact only in hindsight. This is not surprising given the complexity, interdependency,
and size of the systems involved. It is important to note that historical examples, while
necessary for the insight they provide into the dependence of a functioning modern infrastructure
on its automated control systems, do not remotely capture the scale of the
expected EMP scenario. In an EMP event, it is not one or a few SCADA systems that are
malfunctioning (the typical historical scenario) but very large numbers, hundreds or even
thousands over a huge geographic area with a significant fraction of those rendered permanently
inoperable until replaced or physically repaired. Critically, the systems that
would identify what components are damaged and where they are located are also
unavailable in many instances.
Hurricane Katrina, August 2005. Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst U.S. natural
disasters ever, caused a widespread, multi-state blackout that lasted for a prolonged
period, with catastrophic consequences for the afflicted region. The Katrina blackout was
Figure 2-6. Flashover Observed During Injection
Pulse Testing
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
42
a major factor in the failure of police, emergency and rescue services during the hurricane,
which killed 1,464 people. The blackout caused gas stations to cease operating,
paralyzing transportation and greatly impeding evacuation efforts. The Katrina blackout,
which afflicted the region for weeks and lasted for months in some localities, so severely
impeded recovery efforts that even today, 3 years later, New Orleans and its vicinity is
still far from being fully recovered.
August 14, 2003, Blackout. The August 14 blackout was precipitated by a single line
failure in one control area. It eventually affected nine control areas over a period of several
hours, with rapidly spreading cascades of outage over the last 30 minutes. The extent
of the blackout was exacerbated by deficiencies in specific practices, equipment, and
human decisions. Initial retrospectives have focused on three likely contributory causes:
􀂋 Inadequate situational awareness at First Energy Corporation (FEC)
􀂋 FEC’s failure to adequately manage tree growth in its transmission rights-of-way
􀂋 Failure of the interconnected grid’s reliability organizations to provide effective
diagnostic support.
The inadequate situational awareness and failure to provide effective diagnostic support
are closely aligned to the computer and network effects that showed damage and upset
during EMP testing. Additionally, new causal features (not common to other blackout
incidents) of the August 14 blackout include inadequate interregional visibility over the
power system, dysfunction of a control area’s SCADA system, and lack of adequate
backup capability to that system. Thus, all of the factors involved in the August 14 blackout
are expected to be present in control areas impacted by an EMP event, but to a far
greater extent. Therefore, an event as large as the ultimate August 14 blackout could be
part of an initial EMP impact but multiplied several times over a contiguous geographical
and system area. If this effect overlapped the Eastern and Western Interconnections, there
is the increased probability that both interconnections could collapse.
Western States Blackout. The 1996 Western States blackout occurred when an electrically
loaded transmission line sagged onto a tree and caused a short. This type of event is
not uncommon, especially in the heavily treed areas of the Western Interconnect. At
about the same time, a second line tripped (opened) due to improper protective relay activation.
The tripping of the two transmission lines, coupled with a heavy electrical load on
these lines and the thin margins on the transmission system, triggered the widespread
outage through cascading failure. An EMP event could be expected to result in the loss of
numerous transmission lines at once, not just the two cited in this case.
Geomagnetic Storms. Probably one of the most famous and severe effects from solar
storms occurred on March 13, 1989. On this day, several major impacts occurred to the
power grids in North America and the United Kingdom. This included the complete
blackout of the Hydro-Quebec power system and damage to two 400/275 kV autotransformers
in southern England. In addition, at the Salem nuclear power plant in New Jersey,
a 1200 MVA, 500 kV transformer was damaged beyond repair when portions of its
structure failed due to thermal stress. The failure was caused by stray magnetic flux
impinging on the transformer core. Fortunately, a replacement transformer was readily
available; otherwise the plant would have been down for a year, which is the normal
delivery time for larger power transformers. The two autotransformers in southern England
were also damaged from stray flux that produced hot spots, which caused significant
gassing from the breakdown of the insulating oil.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
43
The blackout of the Hydro-Quebec system was caused when seven static voltage-amps
reactive (VAR) compensators (SVC) tripped and shut down due to increased levels of
harmonics on the power lines. The loss of the seven SVCs led to voltage depression and
frequency increase on the system, which caused part of the Quebec grid to collapse. Soon
afterwards, the rest of the grid collapsed because of the abrupt loss of load and generation.
The blackout took less than 90 seconds to occur after the first SVC tripped. About 6
million people were left without power for several hours and, even 9 hours later, there
were still 1 million people without power.
Geomagnetic storms represent an approximation to an E3-induced voltage effect. The
experience to date is of events that may be orders of magnitude smaller in scope and less
severe than that expected from an EMP — although the Commission has also investigated
the impact of a 100-year superstorm. The induced geomagnetic superstorm currents
in the transmission lines will cause hundreds of high voltage transformers to saturate,
creating a severe reactive load in the power system leading to voltage collapse in the
affected area and damage to elements of the transmission system. The nature of this
threat did not allow for experimental testing of the E3 effect, so this historical record is
the best information on the effect.
Distinctions
Past electric power blackouts provide a baseline for assessing the impact of an EMP
attack on the power grid as discussed previously. However, there are several important
factors that distinguish the EMP collapse scenario from these historical experiences.
􀂋 In the historical power system outages, only one or a few critical elements within an
entire system have been debilitated. For example, a power generation facility may trip
because a surge of current is unexpectedly presented through a fault from a particular
load. Yet a substantial portion of the system may well be rendered out of service as the
disruption triggers a series of cascading failures, each instigating the next failure (e.g.,
first a generator trips, then the frequency sags, and a load trips off or a transmission
line trips out with its associated loads, which in turn causes the frequency to overrun
and another generator trips out, and it continues to oscillate until the interconnected
system comes down.) In the case of an EMP attack, elements within many critical
facility components are likely to be damaged or disrupted simultaneously over a relatively
broad geographic area, thus creating an almost certain cascading collapse of the
remaining elements. Similarly, while lightning might strike a single plant, transmission
line, or large load causing it to trip out, lightning has not hit multiple locations spread
over a very wide area of the system with sufficient intensity and hitting all simultaneously
to the extent that would be representative of an EMP attack.
􀂋 During historical outages, the telecommunications system and associated control systems
have continued to function. This provides the system operators with eyes and
ears to know what was damaged, where damage occurred and in some cases the range
of damage. While the power system may still come down, it is more possible to take
protective measures to minimize damage and impact in order to effectuate rapid restoration.
The communications and control systems’ functionality are at high risk of disruption
and damage themselves during an EMP attack. A minimum communications
capability is needed to support immediate responses, to isolate parts for continued
operation, and to implement necessary measures to restore the electrical system.
􀂋 In the early stages of the EMP attack, even before the disruptions could be sensed and
trips could occur that would lead to collapse, some or many of the protective devices
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
44
will be damaged that have ensured critical system components are safe to allow fast
recovery. As a result, some and perhaps much of the electrical system would not be
able to protect itself from the effects of multiple simultaneous and cascading failures.
Widespread damage to the generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructures
and equipment are probable. Rather than simply restoring power to an intact infrastructure
with only a very few damaged components, the recovery task would be to
replace an extensively damaged system under very difficult and decaying circumstances
and then proceeding to restoration.
􀂋 The control systems would be damaged to some extent as opposed to remaining fully
operational as in historical outages. The operations and dispatch centers where the vast
interconnected system is controlled and managed would probably have damaged and
disrupted components, the readings from the system would be fragmented and in many
cases false or nonexistent, and communication by whatever means would be difficult
to impractical to impossible. Control and knowledge would range from unreliable at
best to simply nonexistent. Finding what and where damage has occurred and getting
it repaired would be very problematic in any reasonable time frame, even within the
control centers themselves, let alone out over the vast network with millions of
devices.
􀂋 Skilled labor for a massive and diverse repair effort is not currently available if allocated
over a large geographic area with great numbers of components and devices to
check and repair where necessary. This scope of damage could cover perhaps 70 percent
or possibly more of the continental United States as well as a significant part of
Canada’s population. This is far too large to bring in the limited skilled labor from
very distant points outside the affected area in any reasonable time, even if one could
coordinate them and knew where to send them, and they had the means to get there.
Thus the extensive support from nearby fringe areas used so effectively in historical
outages is likely to be unavailable as a practical matter as they themselves would be
affected. The blackout resulting from Hurricane Katrina, an event comparable to a
small EMP attack, overtaxed the ability of the Nation to quickly restore electric power,
a failure that contributed to the slow recovery of the afflicted region.
􀂋 Other infrastructures would be similarly impacted simultaneously with the electrical
system such as transportation, communication, and even water and food to sustain
crews. The ability to find and get spare parts and components or purchase services
would be severely hampered by lack of normal financial systems in addition to communication,
transportation, and other factors. The Hurricane Katrina blackout caused
precisely such problems.
􀂋 Fuel supplies for the power generation would be interrupted. First, the SCADA and
DCS systems used in delivery of the fuel would be adversely impacted. In addition,
much of the fuel supply infrastructure is dependent upon the electrical system. For
example, natural gas-fired plants (which make up such a large share of the domestic
generation) would be rendered inoperable since their fuel is delivered just in time for
use. Coal plants have stockpiles that variously might be adequate for a week to a
month. The few remaining oil-fired plants similarly have a limited storage of fuel.
Nuclear plants would reasonably be expected to still have fuel but they would have to
forego protective regulations to continue to operate. Many renewable fueled resources
would still have their fuel supply but EMP effects on controls may still render them
inoperable.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
45
It is not possible to precisely predict the time to restore even minimal electrical service
due to an EMP eventuality given the number of unknowns and the vast size and complexity
of the system with its consequent fragility and resiliency. Expert judgment and
rational extrapolation of models and predictive tools suggest that restoration to even a
diminished but workable state of electrical service could well take many weeks, with
some probability of it taking months and perhaps more than a year at some or many locations;
at that point, society as we know it couldn’t exist within large regions of the
Nation. The larger the affected area and the stronger the field strength from the attack
(corollary to extent of damage or disruption), the longer will be the time to recover.
Restoration to current standards of electric power cost and reliability would almost
certainly take years with severe impact on the economy and all that it entails.
Strategy
The electrical system must be protected against the consequences of an EMP event to
the extent reasonably possible. The level of vulnerability and extreme consequence combine
to invite an EMP attack. Thus reduction of our vulnerability to attack and the
resulting consequences reduces the probability of attack. It is also clear the Cold War
type of deterrence through mutual assured destruction is not an effective threat against
many of the potential protagonists, particularly those who are not identifiable nationstates.
The resulting strategy is to reduce sharply the risk of adverse consequences from
an EMP attack on the electrical system as rapidly as possible. The two key elements of
the mitigation strategy for the electrical system are protection and restoration.
The initial focus for reducing adverse consequences should be on the restoration of
overall electrical system performance to meet critical, if not general, societal needs. The
focus should be on the system as a whole and not on individual components of the system.
Timely restoration depends on protection, first of high-value assets, protection necessary
for the ability to restore service quickly to strategically important loads, and finally
protection as required to restore electrical service to all loads. The approach is to utilize a
comprehensive, strategic approach to achieve an acceptable risk-weighted protection in
terms of performance, schedule, timing, and cost. The effort will include evolution to
greater and greater levels of protection in an orderly and cost-effective manner consistent
with the anticipated threat level. Where possible, the protection also will enhance normal
system reliability and, in so doing, provide great service to society overall.
There is a point in time at which the shortage or exhaustion of critical items like emergency
power supply, batteries, standby fuel supplies, replacement parts, and manpower
resources which can be coordinated and dispatched, together with the degradation of all
other infrastructures and their systemic impact, all lead toward a collapse of restoration
capability. Society will transition into a situation where restoration needs increase with
time as resources degrade and disappear. This is the most serious of all consequences and
thus the ability to restore is paramount.
Protection
It is not practical to try to protect the entire electrical power system or even all highvalue
components from damage by an EMP event. There are too many components of too
many different types, manufactures, ages, and designs. The cost and time would be prohibitive.
Widespread collapse of the electrical power system in the area affected by EMP
is virtually inevitable after a broad geographic EMP attack, with even a modest number
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
46
of unprotected components. Since this is a given, the focus of protection is to retain and
restore service to critical loads while permitting relatively rapid restoration.
The approach to protection has the following fundamental aspects. These will collectively
reduce the recovery and restoration times and minimize the net impact from
assault. All of this is feasible in terms of cost and timing if done as part of a comprehensive
and reasonable response to the threats, whether the assault is physical, electromagnetic
(such as EMP), or cyber.
1. Protect high-value assets through hardening. Hardening, providing for special
grounding, and other schemes are required to assure the functional operation of protection
equipment for large high-value assets such as transformers, breakers, and generators
and to so protect against sequential, subsequent impacts from E2 and E3 creating
damage. Protection through hardening critical elements of the natural gas transportation
and gas supply systems to key power plants that will be necessary for electrical
system recovery is imperative.
2. Assure there are adequate communication assets dedicated or available to the electrical
system operators so that damage during system collapse can be minimized; components
requiring human intervention to bring them on-line are identified and located;
critical manpower can be contacted and dispatched; fuel, spare parts and other commodities
critical to the electrical system restoration can be allocated; and provide the
ability to match generation to load and bring the system back on line.
3. Protect the use of emergency power supplies and fuel delivery, and importantly, provide
for their sustained use as part of the protection of critical loads, which loads must
be identified by government but can also be assured by private action. Specifically:
— Increase the battery and on-site generating capability for key substation and control
facilities to extend the critical period allowing recovery. This is relatively low
cost and will improve reliability as well as provide substantial protection against
all forms of attack.
— Require key gasoline and diesel service stations and distribution facilities in geographic
areas to have at-site generation, fueled off existing tanks, to assure fuel
for transportation and other services, including refueling emergency generators in
the immediate area.
— Require key fueling stations for the railroads to have standby generation, similar
to that required for service stations and distribution facilities.
— Require the emergency generator start, operation, and interconnection mechanisms
to be EMP hardened or manual. This will also require the ability to isolate
these facilities from the main electrical power system during emergency generation
operation and such isolation switching must be EMP hardened.
— Make the interconnection of diesel electric railroad engines and large ships possible
and harden such capability, including the continued operation of the units.
— The Government must determine and specify immediately those strategically
important electrical loads critical to the Nation to preserve in such an emergency.
4. Separate the present interconnected systems, particularly the Eastern Interconnection,
into several nonsynchronous connected subregions or electrical islands. It is very
important to protect the ability of the system to retain as much in operation as possible
through reconfiguration particularly of the Eastern Connected System into a number
of nonsynchronous connected regions, so disruptions will not cascade beyond
those EMP-disrupted areas. Basically, this means eliminating total NERC region service
loss, while at the same time maintaining the present interconnection status with
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
47
its inherent reliability and commercial elements. This is the most practical and easiest
way to allow the system to break into islands of service and greatly enhance restoration
timing. This will not protect most within the EMP-insult area, but it should
increase the amount of viable fringe areas remaining in operation. This is fiscally
efficient and can leverage efforts to improve reliability and enhance security against
the broader range of threats, not only EMP. It also can be beneficial to normal system
reliability.
5. Install substantially more black start generation units coupled with specific transmission
that can be readily isolated to balancing loads. The NERC regions now do surveys
of available black start and fuel switchable generation. Requiring all power
plants above a certain significant size to have black start or fuel-switching capability
(with site-stored fuel) would be a very small added expense that would provide major
benefits against all disruptions including nonadversarial ones. Black start generator,
operation, and interconnection mechanisms must be EMP hardened or be manual
without microelectronic dependence. This also will require the ability to isolate these
facilities from the main electrical power system during emergency generation operation
and that isolation switching is EMP hardened. In addition, sufficient fuel must be
provided, as necessary, to substantially expand the critical period for recovery.
6. Improve, extend, and exercise recovery capabilities. Develop procedures for addressing
the impact of such attacks to identify weaknesses, provide training for personnel
and develop EMP response training procedures and coordinate all activities and
appropriate agencies and industry. While developing response plans, training and
coordination are the primary purpose.
Recovery and Restoration
The key to minimizing catastrophic impacts from loss of electrical power is rapid restoration.
The protective strategy described is aimed primarily at preserving the system in a
recoverable state after the attack, maintaining service to critical loads, and enhancing
recovery.
The first step in recovery is identifying the extent and nature of the damage to the system
and then implementing a comprehensive plan with trained personnel and a reservoir
of spare parts to repair the damage. Damage is defined as anything that requires a trained
person to take an action with a component, which can include simply rebooting all the
way to replacing major internal elements of the entire component. A priority schedule for
repair of generation, transmission, and even distribution is necessary since resources of
all types will be precious and in short supply should the EMP impact be broad enough
and interdependent infrastructures be adversely impacted (e.g., communication, transportation,
financial and life-supporting functions).
Restoration is complicated in the best of circumstances, as experienced in past blackouts.
In the instance of EMP attack, the complications are magnified by the unprecedented
scope of the damage both in nature and geographical extent, by the lack of information
post attack, and by the concurrent and interrelated impact on other infrastructures
impeding restoration.
Restoration plans for priority loads are a key focus. Widely scattered or single or small
group loads are in most cases impractical to isolate and restore individually given the
nature of the electrical system. These are to be served first through the emergency power
supply aspects identified in the Protection section. Restoration of special islands can,
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
48
however, be made practical by the nonsynchronous connected subregions if they are
identified by the Government as necessary very far in advance of any assault. Otherwise,
the system’s resources and available personnel will need to act expeditiously to get as
many islands of balanced load and generation back into operation. This will begin by
system operators identifying those easiest to repair (normally the least damaged) and
restore them first. As these stabilize, the system recovery will flow outward as, increment
by increment, the system is repaired and brought back in service. It is much more feasible
and practical to restore by adding incrementally to an operating island rather than black
starting the recovery for an island.
Balancing an isolated portion of generation and load first, and then integrating each
new increment is a reasonably difficult and time-consuming process in the best of circumstances.
In an EMP attack with multiple damaged components, related infrastructure
failures, and difficulty in communications, restoring the system could take a very long
time unless preparatory action is taken.
Generating plants have several advantages over the widely spread transmission network
as it relates to protection and restoration from an EMP event. The plant is one complete
unit with a single DCS control network. It is manned in most cases so operators and
maintenance personnel are immediately available and on site. The operating environment
electronically requires a level of protection that may provide at least a minimal protection
against EMP. Nevertheless, it is important to harden critical controls sufficiently to
enable manual operation at a minimum. Providing for at-site spares to include the probably
needed replacements for control of operation and safety would be straightforward and
not expensive to accomplish, thus assisting rapid restoration of capability.
As controls and other critical components of the electrical transmission and generation
system suffer damage, so do similar components on the production, processing, and
delivery systems providing fuel to the electric generators. Restoration of the electrical
power system is not feasible on a wide scale without a parallel restoration of these fuel
processing and delivery systems.
Hydropower, wind, geothermal, and solar power each has a naturally reoccurring fuel
supply that is unaffected by EMP. However, the controls of these plants themselves are
subject to damage by EMP at present. In addition, only hydropower and geothermal have
controllable fuel (i.e. they can operate when needed versus wind and solar that operate
when nature provides the fuel just-in-time). As a practical matter, only hydropower is of
sufficient size and controllability in some regions to be a highly effective resource for
restoration, such as the Pacific Northwest, the Ohio/Tennessee valley, and northern California.
Beyond the renewable resources, coal and wood waste plants typically have significant
stockpiles of fuel so the delay in rail and other delivery systems for a couple of
weeks and in some instances up to a month is not an issue for fuel. Beyond that, rail and
truck fuel will be needed and delivery times are often relatively slow, so the delivery
process must start well before the fuel at the generator runs out.
Operating nuclear plants do not have a fuel problem per se, but they are prohibited by
regulation from operating in an environment where multiple reliable power supply
sources are not available for safe shutdown, which would not be available in this circumstance.
However, it is physically feasible and safe for nuclear plants to operate in such a
circumstance since they all have emergency generation at site. It would simply have to be
fueled sufficiently to be in operation when the nuclear plant is operating without external
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
49
electrical supply sources. Nuclear power backup would need to be significantly
expanded. Natural gas-fired power plants are very important in restoration because of
their inherent flexibility and often their relatively small size, yet they have no on-site fuel
storage and are totally dependent upon the natural gas supply and gas transportation
system which are just in time for this purpose. Therefore, the natural gas fuel delivery
system must be brought back on-line before these power plants can feasibly operate. It is
operated largely with gas turbines of its own along the major pipelines. The key will be to
have the protection, safety, and controls be hardened against EMP.
Recovery from transmission system damage and power plant damage will be impeded
primarily by the manufacture and delivery of long lead-time components. Delivery time
for a single, large transformer today is typically one to two years and some very large
special transformers, critical to the system, are even longer. There are roughly 2,000
transformers in use in the transmission system today at 345 kV and above with many
more at lesser voltages that are only slightly less critical. No transformers above 100 kV
are produced in the United States any longer. The current U.S. replacement rate for the
345 kV and higher voltage units is 10 per year; worldwide production capacity of these
units is less than 100 per year. Spare transformers are available in some areas and
systems, but because of the unique requirements of each transformer, there are no standard
spares. The spares also are owned by individual utilities and not generally available
to others due to the risk over the long lead time if they are being used. Transformers that
will cover several options are very expensive and are both large and hard to move. NERC
keeps a record of all spare transformers.
Recovery will be limited by the rate of testing and repair of SCADA, DCS, and PLC
and protective relay systems. With a large, contiguous area affected, the availability of
outside assistance, skilled manpower, and spares may well be negligible in light of the
scope of the problem. Information from power industry representatives enables us to
place some limits on how long the testing and repair might take. Determining the source
of a bad electrical signal or tiny component that is not working can take a long time. On
the low side, on-site relay technicians typically take three weeks for initial shakedown of
a new substation. Simply replacing whole units is much faster, but here too, inserting new
electronic devices and ensuring the whole system works properly is still time consuming.
It must be noted that the substations are typically not manned so skilled technicians must
be located, dispatched, and reach the site where they are needed. Many of these locations
are not close to the technicians. It is not possible to readily estimate the time it will take
in the event of an EMP attack since the aftermath of an EMP attack would not be routine
and a certain level of risk would likely be accepted to accelerate return to service. It
seems reasonable, then, to estimate an entire substation control system recovery time to
be at least several days, if not weeks. This assumes that the trained personnel can reach
the damaged locations and will be supported with water, food, communication, spare
parts, and the needed electronic diagnostic equipment.
Unlike generation, recovery of the transmission system will require off-site communications
because coordination between remote locations is necessary. Communications
assets used for this purpose now include dedicated microwave systems and, increasingly,
cell phones and satellite systems. If faced with a prolonged outage of the telecommunications
infrastructures, repairs to dedicated communication systems or establishment of
new ad-hoc communications will be necessary. This might take one or more weeks and
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
50
would set a lower limit on recovery time, but it would be unlikely to affect the duration of
a months-long outage.
Restoration to electrical service of a widely damaged power system is complex. Beginning
with a total blackout, it requires adequate communication to match and coordinate a
generating plant to a load with an interconnected transmission that normally can be isolated
via switching at several substations, so it is not affected by other loads or generation.
The simultaneous loss of communication and power system controls and the resulting
lack of knowledge about the location of the damage all greatly complicate restoration.
There are also a diminishing number of operators who can execute the processes necessary
for restoration without the aid of computers and system controls.
Without communication, both voice and data links, it is nearly impossible to ascertain
the nature and location of damage to be repaired, to dispatch manpower and parts, and to
match generation to load. Transportation limitations further impede movement of material
and people. Disruption of the financial system will make acquisition of services and
parts difficult. In summary, actions are needed to assure that difficult and complex recovery
operations can take place and be effective in an extraordinarily problematic postattack
environment.
The recovery times for various elements of the electrical system are estimated in the
following paragraphs. These should be regarded as very rough best estimates for average
cases derived from the considered judgment of several experts. These estimates are gross
averages, and the situation would vary greatly from one facility to another as the situation,
number of disrupted and damaged elements and the extent of preassault preparedness
and training vary. In addition, the contingencies and backlogs strongly depend on
the extent of such damage elsewhere and are essentially unknown. For example, fuel
delivery capability is a key element. Each of the system elements — generation (including
fuel delivery), transmission, distribution, and often load — must be repaired and in
working order sufficient for manual control at a minimum (each element with skilled personnel
all in communication with each other). Thus, the following should be occurring in
parallel as much as possible, but in some instances testing of one element requires a
working capability of another. The availability of spare parts and trained manpower coupled
with knowledge of what to repair and where it is are critical to recovery timing. The
recovery times provided below are predicated upon the assumption that the other infrastructures
are operating normally. The recovery times would increase sharply with the
absence of other operating infrastructures, which is likely in the EMP situation. These
estimates are based upon present conditions, not what is possible if the Commission recommendations
are followed.
Power Plants
􀂋 Replace damaged furnace, boiler, turbine, or generator: one year plus production backlog
plus transportation backlog. It is uncertain if and to what extent damage to these
elements will occur if the protection schemes are disrupted or damaged.
􀂋 Repair some equipment if spares on site exist, but repair time depends on the type of
plant and personnel available at the plant at the time of the assault: two days to two
weeks plus service backlog at the site or to move trained personnel from plant to plant.
􀂋 Repair and test damaged SCADA, DCS, and computer control system: three months.
􀂋 Return repaired or undamaged plant to operation, provided the major components
under the first bullet are not damaged: (1) nuclear: three days provided there is an
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
51
independent power feed with enough fuel, which should be on site in such an emergency,
(2) coal: two days plus black start or independent power feed, (3) natural gas:
two hours to two days depending on fuel supply and black start, (4) hydro: immediate
to one day, (5) geothermal: one to two days, (6) wind: immediate to one day unless
each turbine requires inspection and then one or two turbines a day.
􀂋 All of the above are also contingent on the availability of fuel. Our recommendations
for on-site reserves: coal: 10-30 days; natural gas: depends on whether the pipeline is
operating; nuclear: 5 days to several weeks; hydro: depends on reservoir capacity
available for continued use.
Transmission and Related Substations
􀂋 Replace irreparably damaged large transformers: One to two years plus production
backlog plus transportation plus transportation backlog (these are very large and
require special equipment to transport that may not be available in this situation).
􀂋 Repair damaged large transformer: one month plus service backlog.
􀂋 Repair manual control system: one month if adequate personnel are available.
􀂋 Establish ad hoc communications: one day to two weeks.
􀂋 Repair and test damaged protective systems: three months.
􀂋 Repair and return of substations to service are also contingent on the local availability
of power. All substations have batteries for uninterrupted power, nominally enough for
eight hours. Very few (about 5 percent) have on-site emergency generators. Many
utilities rented emergency generators in advance of the Y2K transition. Almost all are
now gone. Once the local power is gone, other emergency power often must be
brought to the station for operation.
􀂋 Assuming DC terminals are manned: one week to one month depending upon damage.
Distribution and Related Substations
􀂋 Replace insulators that have flash-over damage: two to five days, unless very
widespread and then weeks.
􀂋 Replace service transformers: two to five days unless very widespread and then weeks.
􀂋 Repair time depends on the number of spares, available crews that perform the repairs,
and equipment.
􀂋 Note that the load on the end of the distribution may have some disruption that needs
repair as well.
Starting an electrical power system from a fully down and black system requires one of
the following two approaches. (1) At the margin of the outage, an operating electrical
system is running at proper frequency with balanced load to generation, and this system
can be interconnected to the fringe of the black portion of the system. The newly interconnected
portion, the portion being restored, must be able to sequentially (in increments
or simultaneously) bring on load and generation to keep the now larger portion of the
system in sufficient frequency balance so the entire system, new and old, does not collapse.
Then another increment is integrated into the operating system and so on. As the
portion that is operating in balance becomes larger and more flexible, the increments that
are able to be added become larger as well, since the operating system can absorb more
and maintain stability. This is how historical outage areas are predominantly restarted. (2)
There is generation that can be black started. This means starting a generator without an
external power source, such as hydroelectric or diesel generation. To do this, the generaCRITICAL
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
52
tion has to be synchronized on line, and a load has to be matched to the generation as it
comes on line. That requires that a transmission link between the generation and the load
be put in service. Yet the transmission link also must be segregated from the rest of the
system, or the load hanging on it would be too large. Both approaches require that the
increment of the system being re-energized to be fully functional (repaired) and communication
established between the generation and load, including any substation or switchyard
between the two. Importantly, it requires skilled personnel to execute the restoration
manually.
The generation must have sufficient fuel to accommodate the load being met in balance.
Water behind a hydroelectric facility may be limited and certainly the diesel fuel is
likely to be limited. Thus the startup must be done carefully because failures could render
the black start inoperable as it runs out of fuel or depletes the battery. Normally, in this
type of situation, the diesel or small hydro is used primarily to start up a larger generator
of a size that can carry the necessary load increment. This larger generator must be
fueled, which can be a complication as discussed elsewhere in this chapter.
Under deregulation, the disconnection (in the business sense) of transmission from generation
that has been occurring in the U.S. electrical power business creates a problem for
black start recovery. There are risks involved in returning a plant to operation and costs
for the needed repairs. Questions about who will pay whom and who will follow whose
direction is not easy to answer, even with everybody wanting to cooperate. Under the
historic utility monopolies, the generation and the transmission assets had a common
owner, so these matters were handled within a single organization. Now, coordination
with independent power producers is nearly unenforceable other than through heavy
government emergency powers noting that power producers and owners want
indemnification before assuming risk. Therefore some degree of command authority is
required for coordination, assessment, and acceptance of risk of damage and financial
settlement of losses.
The time to integrate sufficient portions of a black region of the system using the fringe
approach is reasonably short if the outage area is small in relation to the operating area as
has been seen in past outage conditions. In the case of EMP, where the outage area is
likely to be much larger than the fringe area or there is no fringe area, restoration of even
parts will be measured in weeks to months. If communication is difficult to nonexistent,
restoration can take much longer.
Mitigation of Adverse Consequences
By protecting key system components, structuring the network to maximize fringe service,
through the nonsynchronous interconnections, expanding the black start and system
emergency power support, creating comprehensive recovery plans for the most critical
power needs, and providing adequate training of personnel, the risk of catastrophic
impact to the Nation can be significantly reduced. The mitigation plan must be jointly
developed by the Federal Government and the electric power industry, instilled into systems
operations, and practiced to maintain a ready capability to respond. It must also be
fully coordinated with the interdependent infrastructures, owners, and producers.
The continuing need to improve and expand the electric power system as a normal
course of business provides an opportunity to judiciously improve both security and reliability
in an economically acceptable manner — provided that technically well-informed
decisions are made with accepted priorities. There are a wide variety of potential threats
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
53
besides EMP that must be addressed, which can have serious to potentially catastrophic
impacts on the electrical system. Common solutions must be found that resolve these
multiple vulnerabilities as much as possible. For example, in the course of its work, the
Commission analyzed the impact of a 100-year solar storm (similar to E3 from EMP) and
discovered a very high consequence vulnerability of the power grid. Steps taken to mitigate
the E3 threat also would simultaneously mitigate this threat from the natural environment.
Most of the precautions identified to protect and restore the system from EMP
will also apply to cyber and physical attacks. The Commission notes that the solutions
must not seriously penalize our existing and excellent system but should enhance its performance
wherever possible.
The time for action is now. Threat capabilities are growing and infrastructure reinvestment
is increasingly needed which creates an opportunity for the investment to serve
more than one purpose. Government must take responsibility for improvements in security.
As a general matter, improvements in system security are a Government responsibility,
but it may also enhance reliability if done in certain ways. For example, providing
spare parts, more black start capability, greater emergency back-up, nonsynchronous
interconnections, and more training all will do so. Yet, EMP hardening components will
not increase reliability or enhance operation. Conversely improving reliability does not
necessarily improve security, but it may if done properly. For example, adding more
electronic controls will not enhance EMP security, but electronic spare parts and more
skilled technicians will help improve security and reliability. Finding the right balance
between the utility or independent power producer’s service and fiscal responsibility with
the Government’s security obligation as soon as possible is essential, and that balance
must be periodically (almost continuously) reexamined as technology and system architecture
changes.
Recommendations
EMP attack on the electrical power system is an extraordinarily serious problem but
one that can be reduced below the level of a catastrophic national consequence through
focused effort coordinated between industry and government. Industry is responsible for
assuring system reliability, efficiency, and cost effectiveness as a matter of meeting
required service levels to be paid for by its customers. Government is responsible for
protecting the society and its infrastructure, including the electric power system. Only
government can deal with barriers to attack — interdiction before consequence. Only
government can set the standards necessary to provide the appropriate level of protection
against catastrophic damage from EMP for the civilian sector. Government must validate
related enhancements to systems, fund security-only related elements, and assist in
funding others.
It must be noted, however, that the areas where reliability and security interact represent
the vast majority of cases. The power system is a complex amalgamation of many
individual entities (public, regulated investor-owned, and private), regulatory structures,
equipment designs, types and ages (with some parts well over one hundred years old and
others brand new). Therefore, the structure and approach to modifications must not only
recognize the sharply increased threat from EMP and other forms of attack, but
improvements must be accomplished within existing structures. For example, industry
investment to increase transmission capacity will improve both reliability and system
security during the period when transmission system operating margins are increased.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
54
The Commission concluded that mitigation for a majority of the adverse impact to the
electrical system from EMP is reasonable to undertake in terms of time and resources.
The specific recommendations that follow have been reviewed with numerous entities
with responsibility in this area. The review has been in conceptual terms, with many of
the initiatives coming from these parties, but the recommendations are the Commission’s
responsibility alone. The activities related to mitigation of adverse impacts on fuel supply
to electric generation are more fully discussed in a separate chapter of this report.
Responsibility
As a result of the formation of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with its statutory
charter for civilian matters, coupled with the nature of EMP derived from adversary
activity, the Federal Government, acting through the Secretary of Homeland Security, has
the responsibility and authority to assure the continuation of civilian U.S. society as it
may be threatened through an EMP assault and other types of broad scale seriously damaging
assaults on the electric power infrastructure and related systems.
It is vital that DHS, as early as practicable, make clear its authority and responsibility to
respond to an EMP attack and delineate the responsibilities and functioning interfaces
with all other governmental institutions with individual jurisdictions over the broad and
diverse electric power system. This is necessary for private industry and individuals to act
to carry out the necessary protections assigned to them and to sort out liability and funding
responsibility. DHS particularly needs to interact with FERC, NERC, state regulatory
bodies, other governmental institutions at all levels, and industry in defining liability and
funding relative to private and government facilities, such as independent power plants,
to contribute their capability in a time of national need, yet not interfere with market
creation and operation to the maximum extent practical.
DHS, in carrying out its mission, must establish the methods and systems that allow it
to know, on a continuous basis, the state of the infrastructure, its topology, and key elements.
Testing standards and measurable improvement metrics should be defined as early
as possible and kept up to date.
The NERC and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) are readily situated to
provide much of what is needed to support DHS in carrying out its responsibilities. The
Edison Electric Institute, the American Public Power Association, and the North American
Rural Electric Cooperative Association are also important components for coordinating
activity. Independent power producers and other industry groups normally participate
in these groups or have groups of their own. The manufacturers of generation,
transmission, and distribution components are another key element of the industry that
should be involved. Working closely with industry and these institutions, DHS should
provide for the necessary capability to control the system in order to minimize selfdestruction
in the event of an EMP attack and to recover as rapidly and effectively as
possible.
Multiple Benefit
Most of the recommended initiatives and actions serve multiple purposes and thus are
not only to mitigate or protect against an EMP attack and other assaults on the electric
power system. The protection of the system and rapid restoration of the system from an
EMP attack also are effective against attack from a number of physical threats that
directly threaten to destroy or damage key components of the electrical system. Largescale
natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, also are in large part mitigated by these
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
55
same initiatives. Many of the initiatives enhance reliability, efficiency, and quality of the
electrical supply, which is a direct benefit to the electrical consumer and the U.S.
economy.
To the greatest extent feasible, solutions for EMP should be designed to be useful solutions
to the broad range of security and reliability challenges. For example, black start
resources are essential for many threats, purposeful or not, to the power grid. Integrating
cyber security and EMP hardness into control systems simultaneously as these systems
are routinely upgraded will be much more effective and less costly than doing two separate
jobs.
Recommended Initiatives
The following initiatives must be implemented and verified by DHS and DOE, utilizing
industry and other governmental institutions to assure the most cost effective outcome
occurs and that it does so more rapidly than otherwise possible. In many instances, these
initiatives are extensions or expansions of existing procedures and systems such as those
of NERC.
􀂋 Understand system and network level vulnerabilities, including cascading effects—To
better understand EMP-related system response and recovery issues, conduct in-depth
research and development on system vulnerabilities. The objective is to identify cost
effective and necessary modifications and additions in order to further achieve the
overall system performance. Specifically there should be government-sponsored
research and development of components and processes to identify and develop new
consequential and cost effective approaches and activities.
􀂋 Evaluate and implement quick fixes—Identify what may presently be available
commercially to provide cost effective patches and snap-on modifications to quickly
provide significant protection and limit damage to high-value generation and transmission
assets as well as emergency generation and black start capability. These include
installation or modification of equipment as well as changes in operating practices.
This is both fast and low cost.
􀂋 Develop national and regional restoration plans—The plans must prioritize the rapid
restoration of power with an emphasis on restoring critical loads that are identified by
the Government. The plans must be combined with the requirements for providing and
maintaining emergency power service by these loads. The plans must address outages
with wide geographic effect, multiple component failure, poor communication capability,
and failure of islanding schemes within the affected area. Government and
industry responsibilities must be assigned and clearly delineated. Indemnification
arrangements must be put into place to allow industry to implement the Government’s
priorities as well as deal with potential environmental and electrical hazards to ensure
rapid recovery. Planning must address not only the usual contingency for return to
normal operating condition, but also restoration to a reduced capability for minimum
necessary service. Service priorities under duress may be different from priorities
under normal conditions. The planning basis for reduced capability should be the
minimum necessary connectivity, generation assumptions based on reduced fuel availability
scenarios, and reduced load, with the goal of universal service at limited power.
National Guard and other relevant resources and capabilities must be incorporated.
􀂋 Assure availability of replacement equipment—On hand or readily available spare
parts to repair or replace damaged electronic and larger power system components
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
56
must be available in sufficient quantities and in locations to allow for rapid correction
and restoration commensurate with a post-EMP attack and its impacts on related infrastructures
such as communication and transportation. NERC already has a spare component
database for such large items as transformers and breakers that is expanding to
include delivery capability, but now must be revised to accommodate an EMP attack
environment. Where additional spare components need to be acquired or delivery
made possible to critical locations, DHS must work with NERC and industry to identify
the need and provide the spares or delivery capability; such as the critical material
and strategic petroleum reserves and similar strategic reserves. The key will be to
decide where to draw the line between reserves for reliability and those for security. It
also will be necessary to keep the equipment current. In addition, strategic manufacturing
and repair facilities themselves might be provided with emergency generation to
minimize stockpiles. This would also be of benefit to industry as well as enhance security.
Research is underway and should be further pursued, into the production of multiple
use emergency replacement transformers, breakers, controls, and other critical
equipment. Such devices would trade efficiency and device service life for modularity,
transportability and affordability. They would not be planned for normal use. Movement,
stockpiles and protection of stockpiles must be integrated with National Guard
and other relevant capabilities.
􀂋 Assure availability of critical communications channels—Assure that throughout the
system there are local and system-wide backup EMP survivable communication systems
adequate for command and control of operations and restoration of the electrical
system. The most critical communications channels are the ones that enable recovery,
not normal operations. Planning must presume that, for the near term at least, computer-
based control systems will not be capable of supporting post-EMP operations.
The most critical communication assets are thus the in-house ones that enable manual
operation and system diagnostics. Dispatch communication is next in importance.
Communications to coordinate black start are also vital. NERC should review and
upgrade operating procedures and information exchanges between and among existing
control centers, key substations, and generating plants to recognize and deal as effectively
as possible with EMP, building upon the systems, procedures, and databases
currently in place. Local emergency and 9-1-1 communications centers, the National
Guard and other relevant communication systems, and redundant capabilities should
be incorporated where possible.
􀂋 Expand and extend emergency power supplies—Add to the number of stand-alone
back-up and emergency power supplies such as diesels and long-life batteries. This
addition is vital and a least-cost protection of critical service. The loss of emergency
power before restoration of the external power supply is likely to occur in present circumstances
and is highly probable to be devastating. Presently such emergency power
is useable only for relatively short periods due mostly to at-site stored fuel limitations,
which have become increasingly limited. The length of time recommended for each
location and load will be determined by DHS and industry where the emergency supply
is private, such as with hospitals, financial institutions, and telecommunication
stations. The specific recommendations are:
— Increase the battery and on-site generating capability for key substation and control
facilities to extend the critical period allowing recovery. This action is relatively
low cost and will improve reliability as well as provide substantial protection
against all forms of attack.

— Require key gasoline and diesel fuel service stations and liquid fuel distribution
facilities in geographic areas to have at-site generation, fueled from existing atsite
storage to assure fuel for transportation and other services, including refueling
emergency generators in the immediate area.
— Require that key fueling stations for the railroads have standby generation much
as the previously mentioned service stations and distribution facilities.
— Require the emergency generator start, operation, and interconnection mechanisms
to be EMP hardened or manual. This action will also require the ability to
isolate these facilities from the main electrical power system during emergency
generation operation and require that such isolation switching be EMP hardened.
— Where within safety parameters extend the emergency generation life through
greater fuel storage or supply sources (with their own emergency power supplies).
Fuel supplies for more critical facilities must be extended to at least a week or
longer, where possible. This action will probably entail careful use or development
of relatively near location (but not contiguous) fuel stockpiles with their
own emergency generation.
— Regularly test and verify the emergency operations. If the Government were to
enforce current regulations, many of the public facilities with standby generation
would be routinely tested and failures could be avoided.
— Provide for the local integration of railroad mobile diesel electric units with
switching and controls hardened against EMP. The same should be provided for
large ships at major ports.
􀂋 Extend black start capability—Systemwide black start capabilities must be assured
and exercised to allow for smaller and better islanding and faster restoration. The
installation of substantially more black start generations units and dual feed capable
units (e.g., natural gas-fired units that can operate on #2 oil stored on site) coupled
with specific transmission that can be readily isolated to balance loads for restoration
is necessary. Sufficient fuel must be provided to substantially expand the critical
period for recovery such as with multiple start attempts. The NERC regions now do
surveys of available black start and fuel switchable generation. Requiring all power
plants above a certain significant size to have black start or at-site fuel switching
capability (with at-site stored fuel) would be a very small added expense, and would
provide major benefits against all disruptions including nonadversarial, so it is both an
industry and security benefit. The start, operation, and control systems for such
capability have to be EMP hardened or manual, recognizing that most large power
plants have personnel on site.
􀂋 Prioritize and protect critical nodes— Government entities, such as DHS and DOE,
must identify promptly those specific loads that are critical to either remain in service
or to be restored as a priority with target restoration to be within a matter of hours following
an EMP attack. These may well include loads necessary to assure the continuation
of all forms of emergency response care and recovery. These must include
what is necessary to avoid collapse of, or allow for the rapid recovery of financial
systems, key telecommunication systems, the Government’s command and control in
the civilian sector, and those elements that allow for rapid and effective recovery of
the electric power system in a more general sense. These loads must be prioritized so
that the most critical can be protected and designed for rapid restoration in the near
term and then add more next-level priority loads as resources permit. The above recommendations
for extended and adequate emergency power supply are the most direct
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
58
and cost efficient approach. The shift to nonsynchronous, interconnected islands is the
secondary application, but it will take longer and is more expensive. Providing such
islands of small-to-modest size to support large loads can best assure no loss of power
supply or far more rapid restoration.
􀂋 Expand and assure intelligent islanding capability—Direct the electrical system
institutions and entities to expand the capability of the system to break into islands of
matching load and generation, enhancing what now exists to minimize the impact and
provide for more rapid and widespread recovery. The establishment of nonsynchronous
connections between subregions, perhaps beginning with NERC already identified
subregions, should be required. This can readily be accomplished today with
approaches such as DC back-to-back converter installations that facilitate power transfers
but maintain a barrier. This mode of operation between regions is often referred to
as maintaining frequency independence. Reconfiguration of the Eastern Connected
System into a number of such nonsynchronous connected regions could eliminate
large service interruptions, while still maintaining the present interconnection status. It
may be a priority to first establish smaller islands of frequency independence to better
assure power supply to government-identified critical loads that are nominally too
large for most emergency power supplies, such as large financial centers, and telecommunication
hubs. Incidental to any studies could be new ideas for conversion of
HVAC transmission lines to HVDC operation for greater transmission capacity as a
further and corollary benefit. Also new ideas are being discussed, such as, where the
converter transformers can be eliminated, resulting in a substantial cost reduction.
Asynchronous regional connections is a common term used to identify this broad area
technically. The protective and control systems necessary to implement this capability
will have to be hardened. It will not be a retrofit but simply a part of the initial design
and procedures, so the cost for EMP protection is small. Note that the DC or other
interface making the nonsynchronous connection possible is not sized for the entire
electrical capacity within the respective island but is sufficient only for reliability and
commercial transactions, which normally is far less. Sizing this interface is a special
effort that needs to be established primarily by NERC and FERC but with Federal
coordination. Breaking the larger electrical power system into subsystem islands of
matching load and generation will enhance what now exists to minimize the impact,
decrease likelihood of broad systemwide collapse, and provide for more rapid and
widespread recovery. It is just as useful for normal reliability against random disturbances
or natural disasters in reducing size and time for blackouts. Thus it is critical
for protection and restoration coming from any type of attack, not just EMP. Ensuring
this islanding capability in the event of EMP is critical, although it requires a longerterm
system design and implementation.
􀂋 Assure protection of high-value generation assets—Enhance the survivability of
generating plants at the point of system collapse due to the very broad and simultaneous
nature of an EMP attack. NERC, EPRI, equipment and control system providers,
and utilities need to aggressively evaluate and verify what is vulnerable to EMP and
commensurate consequences. Generating plants can be severely damaged from large
electrical faults or incursions in the absence of protective devices. They can also be
occasionally damaged in the event of sudden load loss if protective shutdown systems
fail. Control systems used in generation facilities are inherently less robust than their
counterparts in transmission and thus are more susceptible to EMP disruption. They
are highly computer controlled which further exacerbates their risk to EMP. Yet at the
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
59
same time, they have trained personnel on site who with proper training, procedures,
and spare parts, can greatly assist in restoration. System-level protection assurance is
more complex due to the need for multiple systems to function in proper sequence.
Lead times on generation components are even longer than for major transmission
components. Existing coal plants make up nearly half the Nation’s generation, but they
generally have the most robust control systems with many remaining electromechanical
controls still in operation. Natural gas-fired combustion turbines and associated
steam secondary systems represent the newest significant contribution to the
generation. These are mostly all modern electronic- and computer-based control and
protective systems and are considered very vulnerable to EMP. Their fuel systems are
not on site and will also be interrupted due to EMP. Nuclear plants have many redundant
and fail-safe systems, but they too are very electronically controlled. The key difference
with nuclear power plants is the extensive manual control capability and
training, making them less vulnerable than the others. Hydroelectric is the next substantial
generation element and is the most robust, although its older mechanical and
electromechanical controls are being replaced at a rapid rate. Black start generation is
normally quite secure but start and frequency controls will need to be protected from
EMP. The highest priority generation assets are those needed for black start, but all are
critical for restoration of any meaningful service.
􀂋 Assure protection of high-value transmission assets—Ability to withstand EMP must
be assured at the system level. Priority for protection is on the highest voltage, and on
the highest power units serving the longest lines; these require the most time to replace
and are the most vulnerable in the absence of normal protections due to E1 and provide
the major flow and delivery of power. Provisions must be made for the protection
of large high-value assets such as transformers and breakers against the loss of
protection and sequential subsequent impacts from E2 and E3 creating damage. E3
ground-induced current impacts are important from an industry standpoint since they
can occur beyond E3 due to the risk of large, 100-year geomagnetic solar storms. For
E3 this could include adding either permanent or switchable resistance to ground in the
neutral of large transformers. This protection would then be available upon notice of
the onset of a solar storm or sufficient threat of EMP attack. Thus it provides a simple
expedient that does not compromise performance under normal operation. Due to the
interconnected nature of the grid and to the need for that connectivity to enable
recovery, the likelihood of a blackout lasting years over large portions of the affected
region is substantial with damage to these high-value components. The islanding of the
system through nonsynchronous connections may help reduce the E2 and E3 impacts
by shortening the long line coupling in some instances.
􀂋 Assure sufficient numbers of adequately trained recovery personnel—Expand levels of
manpower and training as they are otherwise limited to only that needed for efficient
normal power operation that is highly and increasingly computer aided. Industry and
government must work together to enhance recovery capability.
􀂋 Simulate, train, exercise, and test the recovery plan— Develop two or three centers for
the purpose of simulating EMP and other major system threatening attacks. Develop
procedures for addressing the impact of such attacks to identify weaknesses, provide
training for personnel and develop EMP response training procedures and coordination
of all activities and appropriate agencies and industry. While developing response
plans, training and coordination are the primary purpose, identifying vulnerabilities
through “red team” exercises is also important for identifying, prioritizing, and rectiCRITICAL
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
60
fying weaknesses. The centers would each focus on one of the three main integrated
electrical networks — Eastern Grid, Western Grid, and Texas. These centers may be
able to effectively utilize facilities such as the TVA bunker and the BPA control center
in order to conserve resources and achieve rapid results. DOE facilities and other no
longer utilized facilities should also be examined. Develop simulators to train and
develop procedures similar to the airline industry. Exercising black start will require
indemnification of power providers.
􀂋 Develop and deploy system test standards and equipment—Test and evaluate the
multitude of system components to ensure that system vulnerability to EMP is identified
and mitigation and protection efforts are effective. Device-level standards and test
equipment exist for normal power line disturbances (EMC standards), but protection at
the system level is the more important goal. System-level improvements such as isolators,
line protection, and grounding improvements will be the most practical and
least expensive in most cases rather than replacement of individual component
devices.
􀂋 Establish installation standards—More robust installation standards must be identified
and implemented as appropriate — such as short shielded cables, circumferential
grounding, arrestors on leads, surge protectors, and similar activities. These should
include more robust system standards — such as proximity to protected device, no
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computers in mission critical roles and similar matters.
In some instances, these will qualify as add-ons and replacements during the early
period initiatives. The Government should complete the testing and evaluation work
that the Commission initiated to set hardening standards for electric power protective
systems. Government should provide fiscal assistance to industry in implementing the
needed hardening solutions.
Cost and Funding of Selected Initiatives
It must be noted that the very wide variety of components; installation techniques; local
system designs; age of components, subsystems, and controls located within buildings or
exposed; and so forth all drastically affect the type and expense for implementing the
recommended initiatives. Internal DHS and other governmental costs are assumed to be
absorbed. A significant portion of the labor to affect the modifications is already in place.
Often the modification will be part of a program for repair, replacement and modernization
that is continuing regardless of the EMP mitigation program. The addition of nonsynchronous
connection capability once defined is a contract function coupled with atsite
staffing and control system interfaces. All of this effort factors into the cost estimates
and results in fairly wide ranges in most instances. Only the costs for some of the larger
or more system-specific initiatives are estimated here (in 2007 dollars).
􀂋 There are several thousand major transformers and other high-value components on
the transmission grid. Protective relays and sensors for these components are more
than that number but less than twice. A continual program of replacement and upgrade
with EMP-hardened components will substantially reduce the cost attributable
uniquely to EMP. Labor for installation is already a part of the industry work force.
The estimated cost for add-on and EMP-hardened replacement units and EMP protection
schemes is in the range of $250 million to $500 million.
􀂋 Approximately 5,000 generating plants of significance will need some form of added
protection against EMP, particularly for their control systems. In some instances the
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 2. Electric Power
61
fix is quite inexpensive and in others it will require major replacements. The estimated
cost is in the range of $100 million to $250 million.
􀂋 The addition of nonsynchronous interfaces to create subregion islands is not known
with reasonable certainty, but it might be in the order of $100 million to $150 million
per island. The pace of creating islands and their priority will be established by DHS
in consultation with NERC and FERC. Moving to at least six or more fairly rapidly is
a fair assumption. There will be annual operating costs of around $5 million per island.
􀂋 The simulation and training centers are assumed at three — one for each interconnect
— for a cost in the range of $100 million to $250 million plus annual operating costs
of around $25 million per year.
􀂋 Protection of controls for emergency power supplies should not be too expensive since
hard-wired manual start and run capability should be in place for many, which is adequate.
Furthermore, the test, adjust, and verification will be carried out by the entity
that owns the emergency power supply as part of normal operating procedures. Retrofit
of protective devices such as filters might be accomplished at a cost of less than
$30,000 per generator for newer generators with vulnerable electronic controls. Hardening
the connection to the rest of the facility power system requires a protected internal
distribution system from the backup generator.
􀂋 Switchable ground resistors for high-value transformers are estimated to cost in the
range of $75 million to $150 million.
􀂋 The addition of new black start generation with system integration and protected controls
is estimated to cost around $12 million per installation. Probably no more than
150 such installations will need to be added throughout the United States and Canadian
provinces. Adding dual fuel capability to natural gas-fired generation is done for
the economic purpose of the owner, yet it has the same value as the addition of black
start generation. The addition of fuel storage for the existing black start units is relatively
small, about $1 million each.
􀂋 The addition of emergency generation at the multitude of sites including fuel and
transportation sites is probably around $2 million to $5 million each.
􀂋 The cost for monitoring, on a continuous basis, the state of the electric infrastructure,
its topology, and key elements plus for assessing the actual EMP vulnerability, validation
of mitigation and protection, maintenance, and surveillance data for the system at
large cannot be estimated since it falls under many existing government-funded activities,
but in any event, it is not considered significant.
􀂋 Research and development activities are a level-of-effort funding that needs to be
decided by DHS. Redirection of existing funding is also likely to occur.
􀂋 Funding for the initiatives above is to be divided between industry and government.
Government is responsible for those activities that relate directly and uniquely to the
purpose of assuring continuation of the necessary functioning of U.S. society in the
face of an EMP attack or other broadly targeted physical or information systems
attack. Industry is responsible for all other activities including reliability, efficiency
and commercial interests. Industry is also the best source for advice on cost effective
implementation of the initiatives.

Chapter 3. Telecommunications
Introduction
Telecommunications provides the connectivity that links the elements of our society
together. It is a vital capability that plays an integral role in the normal day-to-day routine
of the civilian, business, and government sectors of society. It is a critical enabler for the
functioning of our national financial infrastructure, as transactions representing trillions
of dollars flow daily via telecommunications. It enables agencies of local, state, and federal
government to discharge their duties. People can communicate on the go, almost
anytime and virtually anywhere because of telecommunications, as exemplified by more
than 100 million cellular subscribers in the United States (U.S.). Telecommunications
provides a vital pathway between emergency response personnel in crisis situations. It
has transformed, via the Internet and advances in technology, the way business and society
in general operate. Downloading music and video content using the Internet instead of
in-store purchases, using cell phones to interactively gather travel directions instead of
using paper maps, and using remote sensors and video streams to send security information
over a communications network to a central site for appropriate dispatch instead of
using on-site security guards are examples of these changes.
Telecommunications can be thought of as:
􀂋 The mix of equipment used to initiate and receive voice, data, and video messages
(e.g., cell phones and personal computers).
􀂋 The associated media (e.g., fiber optics and copper) and equipment (e.g., multiplexers)
that transport those messages.
􀂋 The equipment that routes the messages between destinations (e.g., Internet Protocol
[IP]-based routers).
􀂋 The basic and enhanced services offered by communications carriers such as AT&T,
Verizon Wireless, and Comcast.
􀂋 The supporting monitoring and management systems that identify, mitigate, and repair
problems that can impact performance of services.
􀂋 The supporting administrative systems for functions such as billing.
This chapter discusses civilian telecommunications. Among the main trends to consider
in evaluating the impact of EMP on these telecommunications networks in the next 15
years are:
􀂋 The dramatic growth in the number of wireless networks and in the use of wireless
services.
􀂋 Improvements in the technology and reliability associated with optical networks leveraging
heavy fiber deployment (fiber is generally viewed positively in terms of EMP
survivability).
􀂋 Shrinking work forces used in managing networks and an associated increase in
dependence on automation and software “diagnostic smarts” to support maintenance,
problem isolation and recovery, and other performance impacting functions.
􀂋 An architectural evolution toward a converged network in which voice, data, and
video traffic are carried over the same network.
When fully implemented, this evolution to a converged network will represent a major
change-out of the equipment that existed in the 1990s, and that still exists, in the U.S.

telecommunications network. Thus, it represents an opportunity for EMP hardening considerations
to be included as the transition occurs.
Telecommunications service providers have proclaimed that carrying voice, data, and
video together over converged networks is an underpinning of their strategic directions.
Service providers point to the fact that traffic residing on embedded, older technology
will be transitioned to this new converged network within financial and regulatory constraints.
1 While this converged network evolution has begun, it is expected to continue
for an additional decade or more.
The reason for a lengthy transition can be better understood by reviewing some historical
factors related to the U.S. telecommunications network. Several factors led to traffic
being carried by separate networks, including differences in the characteristics of voice,
data, and video traffic; the relative dominance in the amount of voice traffic over data and
video; and the technological state of the carrier network equipment.
With respect to traffic characteristics:
􀂋 Voice communications generally are characterized by real-time interactions with typical
durations of a few minutes.
􀂋 Data communications tend to occur in bursts and may consume large amounts of bandwidth
during these bursts. Data communications users often access networks for long
holding times that may range into hours.
􀂋 Video traffic typically is characterized by high-bandwidth, long-duration, one-way
transmission such as distributing cable TV content to viewers with lower-bandwidth
traffic sent from the subscriber to the service provider, for example, to signal the
selection of a specific on-demand program.
With respect to traffic mixes:
􀂋 As the 1990s progressed, the growth of data traffic exploded, fueled in large part by
Internet usage. Data communications growth is continuing at a rapid pace, while
growth in voice has remained relatively flat. Some estimates have data traffic already
exceeding voice traffic beginning around the year 2000.
􀂋 The growth in data communications traffic has made it more fiscally attractive to find
technological solutions that avoid the expense of maintaining separate voice and data
networks.
With respect to technology evolution:
􀂋 Voice communications over the past decade have been handled primarily by carrier
equipment called digital circuit switches. The switches are engineered based on statistical
usage of the network that assumes not all of the individual users, traditionally in
the thousands, served by those individual switches will try to gain access simultaneously.
These switches, of which several thousand are deployed, were not designed to
effectively handle the characteristics of data and video traffic.
􀂋 Router technology has evolved rapidly. Advances in protocols that support assigning
quality of service (QoS) requirements for different traffic mixes and greater processing
speed and capacity have provided solutions for handling voice, data, and video using a
common set of equipment.

􀂋 Service providers implement new technologies slowly. This is prudent given the complexity
of the networks in question and a desire to prove-in technologies and fine-tune
network management procedures prior to wide-scale deployment.
Telecommunications Support During Emergencies
There is a recognition at the highest levels of government and industry that telecommunications
plays a critical role, not only in the normal day-to-day operations of society, but
also in reconstituting societal functions and mitigating human, financial, and physical
infrastructure losses during man-made and natural disasters. This has led to government
and industry partnering to codify processes, organizational structures, and services to
address these disasters. Among these codifications are the National Communications
System (NCS) and a set of services known as National Security and Emergency Preparedness
(NS/EP) services.
The NCS was established by Executive Order 12472, Assignment of National Security
and Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications Functions.2 These functions include
administering the National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications (NCC) to
facilitate the initiation, coordination, restoration, and reconstitution of NS/EP telecommunications
services or facilities under all crises and emergencies; developing and
ensuring the implementation of plans and programs that support the viability of telecommunications
infrastructure hardness, redundancy, mobility, connectivity, and security;
and serving as the focal point for joint industry-government and interagency NS/EP telecommunications
planning and partnerships.
With respect to the NS/EP telecommunications services, a set of evolving capabilities
exist for:
􀂋 Prioritizing telephone calls through the wireline and wireless networks during time
intervals when call volumes are excessive and facilities may be degraded.
􀂋 Giving priority to restoring emergency and essential services that may be damaged or
degraded.
􀂋 Rapidly getting new telecommunications connections into operation.
􀂋 Keeping carriers communicating with government and one another on an on-going
basis during crises events.
NS/EP-related definitions are noted below.
NS/EP Definitions
NS/EP Telecommunications Services—Telecommunications services that are used to maintain a state of readiness or
to respond to and manage any event or crisis (local, national, or international) that causes or could cause injury or
harm to the population, damage to or loss of property, or degrades or loss of property, or degrades or threatens the
NS/EP posture of the United States. (Telecommunications Service Priority [TSP] System for National Security
Emergency Preparedness: Service User Manual, NCS Manual 3-1-1, Appendix A, July 9, 1990)
NS/EP Requirements—Features that maintain a state of readiness or respond to and manage an event or crisis (local,
national, or international), which causes or could cause injury or harm to the population, damage to or loss of property,
or degrade or threaten the NS/EP posture of the United States. (Federal Standard 1037C)
Emergency NS/EP and Essential NS/EP—Emergency NS/EP telecommunication services are those new services that
are ‘‘so critical as to be required to be provisioned at the earliest possible time without regard to the costs of obtaining
them.’’ An example of Emergency NS/EP service is federal government activity in response to a Presidential
declared disaster or emergency. Telecommunications services are designated as essential where a disruption of ‘‘a
few minutes to one day” could seriously affect the continued operations that support the NS/EP function. (Federal
Register/Vol. 67, No. 236, December 9, 2002/Notices)
2 Executive Order 12472, April 3, 1984.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 3. Telecommunications
65
These NCS and NS/EP services are capabilities that would be drawn upon in an EMP
event, and they will evolve as the U.S. telecommunications network evolves. This commitment
to evolution has been reinforced, for example, by testimony from Frank Libutti
(Undersecretary, Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection, Department of
Homeland Security) before the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations in
2004:
The NCS is continuing a diverse set of mature and evolving programs
designed to ensure priority use of telecommunications services by NS/EP
users during times of national crisis. The more mature services—including
the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) and the
Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP)—were instrumental in the
response to the September 11 attacks. FY 2005 funding enhances these
programs and supports added development of the Wireless Priority Service
(WPS) program and upgrades to the Special Routing Arrangement
Service (SRAS). Specifically, priority service programs include: (1)
GETS, which offers nationwide priority voice and low-speed data service
during an emergency or crisis situation; (2) WPS, which provides a
nationwide priority cellular service to key NS/EP users, including individuals
from Federal, state and local governments and the private sector;
(3) TSP, which provides the administrative and operational framework for
priority provisioning and restoration of critical NS/EP telecommunications
services. In place since the mid-1980s, more than 50,000 circuits are protected
today under TSP, including circuits associated with critical infrastructures
such as electric power, telecommunications, and financial services.;
(4) SRAS, which is a variant of GETS to support the Continuity of
Government (COG) program including the reengineering of SRAS in the
AT&T network and development of SRAS capabilities in the MCI and
Sprint networks, and; (5) the Alerting and Coordination Network (ACN)
which is an NCS program that provides dedicated communications
between selected critical government and telecommunications industry
operations centers.3
EMP Impact on Telecommunications
To aid in understanding the impact of EMP on telecommunications, figure 3-1 provides
a simplified diagram of a telecommunications network.
Service subscribers communicate through a local node. For example, a cellular subscriber
communicates through a cell tower controlled by a cellular base station. If communication
is with a party located on another local node, the communications traffic may
be routed through the backbone to the distant local node for delivery to the other party.
The backbone connects to thousands of local nodes and in doing so serves a transport and
routing function to move voice, data, or video traffic between or among the communicators.
It consists of a mix of equipment that provides high-speed connectivity between the
local nodes. In an actual network if there is sufficient traffic between two local nodes,
they may be directly connected by transmission media such as fiber links. Figure 3-1
shows some network equipment, such as a digital switch and a network router. The control
network collects information statistics from the equipment in the local nodes and

backbone that help manage the network’s performance. The backbone has been the main
focus of industry in deploying components of the converged network to date, and it is the
furthest along with respect to the converged network vision.
A set of first-order assumptions drove the analytical assessment of EMP impacts on
telecommunications:
􀂋 In a crisis, voice services will be viewed as critical, with the percent of call attempts
completed as a key metric.
􀂋 The backbone, as depicted in figure 3-1, is where the greatest influx of new equipment
has been deployed. This is newer-vintage, expensive, high-end routing and transport
equipment connected by fiber optics. An assumption is that the equipment will be
highly survivable up to high E1 EMP levels and perhaps will experience only transient
effects at those levels, but this needs to be verified with further testing.
􀂋 The local nodes will be replaced with equipment supporting the converged network
vision, but this change-out will continue beyond the time frame examined in this
Commission study. Commission-sponsored testing provided insights into the performance
of the new equipment that is being incorporated into the converged network.
Among the current local node equipment are digital circuit switches and other equipment
that have been tested and analyzed as part of a prior assessment of E1 EMP on
telecommunications conducted in the early 1990s.4 In this study, circuit switch

manufacturers noted they would be incorporating equipment changes to address a
majority of the items shown to be susceptible to E1 EMP in the products tested, and
the Commission assessments assume this to be the case.
Keeping these factors in mind, the Commission focused its analytical efforts on customer
premises equipment (CPE), the subsequent impact on demand levels at the local
nodes and local node equipment, and the subsequent ability to complete calls assuming a
robust backbone.
On the demand side, call origination electronic assets have the potential for EMP disruption
or damage. A key issue is whether EMP will impact the operation of telephones,
cell phones, and computer systems (like those shown in figure 3-1) and, as such, reduce
the demand placed on assets in the local and backbone elements that move information
between information senders and receivers.
The major elements of the civilian telecommunication network are electronic systems
with circuit boards, integrated circuit chips, and cable connections such as routers that
switch and transport information between users of the network (e.g., transport phone
calls). Like the equipment that generates demand on the network, these electronics have
an inherent vulnerability to EMP threats. The majority of these critical switching and
transport assets that are part of the local and backbone nodes in figure 3-1 are housed in
Central Offices (COs). Typically COs are windowless concrete buildings. Sometimes
equipment used to provide service to end users is housed in Controlled Environmental
Vaults (CEV). These are smaller structures that provide environmental control similar to
that of a CO. Wireless base stations supporting cellular communications are housed in
structures similar to CEVs. Finally, some equipment such as that used to provide highspeed
Internet service may be installed in small cabinets and enclosures without environmental
controls.
Regardless of the installation location, telecommunications equipment and the facilities
that contain them follow strict rules and requirements to protect against natural or unintentional
electromagnetic disturbances, such as lightning, electromagnetic interference,
electrostatic discharge, and power influences on telecom cables. Typical protection techniques
include grounding, bonding, shielding, and the use of surge protective devices.
However, an EMP attack exhibits unique characteristics, such as rapid rise-time transients,
and the existing protection measures were not specifically intended for or tested
against EMP.
Given these network characteristics, some factors that contribute to mitigating EMP
effects on telecommunications are:
􀂋 Industrywide groups that systematically share best practices and lessons learned to
improve network reliability, such as the Network Reliability and Interoperability
Council (NRIC).
􀂋 Availability of NS/EP telecommunications capabilities.
􀂋 Volume, geographic diversity, and redundant deployment of telecommunications
equipment assets, coupled with wireline, wireless, satellite, and radio as alternative
means for communications.
􀂋 Deployment of fiber-optic technology within telecommunications carrier networks.
􀂋 Use of standard bonding and grounding practices for telecommunications equipment
deployed in carrier networks.

􀂋 Historical performance of terrestrial carrier networks in electromagnetic events such as
lightning and geomagnetic storms.
The Commission sponsored testing and analytical efforts that led to the conclusion that
an EMP attack would disrupt or damage a functionally significant fraction of the electronic
circuits in the Nation’s civilian telecommunications systems in the geographic
region exposed to EMP. Cellular networks are seen as being less robust to EMP than
landline networks due to a combination of the higher susceptibility of cellular network
equipment to damage and more limited backup power capacity at cell sites than at counterpart
landline network equipment sites.
The analysis suggested that damage to telephones, cell phones, and other communications
devices would not be sufficient to curtail higher than normal call volumes on the
civilian telecommunications network after exposure to either low or high E1 EMP levels.
As such, the remaining operational network would be subjected to high levels of call
attempts for some period of time after the attack, leading to degraded telecommunications
services. Key government and nongovernment personnel will need priority access to use
public network resources to coordinate and support local, regional, and national recovery
efforts. This will be especially problematic during the interval of severe network congestion.
Services such as GETS will be crucially important during these periods of high call
demand.
The Commission’s expectation is that the impact of a low E1 EMP level exposure
would be dominated by the inability to handle the spike in call traffic on landline networks,
because the direct impacts on equipment are expected to be largely transient and
short term in nature (minutes to hours) with minimal manual restoration. For cellular networks,
the impact will be greater (minutes to days) due to the expected levels of manual
recovery, more limited backup power at cell sites, and the large number of cellular base
stations that serve as key controllers of communications between cell towers and cell
phones. The results of limited testing on cellular base stations indicate EMP vulnerabilities
that require further examination.
As noted in the electric power section of the Commission report, the loss of portions of
the power grid is likely, even for a relatively low-level EMP attack. The longer-term performance
of the public telecommunications network and associated NS/EP services will
depend, therefore, on the use of backup power capabilities and the rapidity with which
primary power can be restored. To offset a loss of electric power, telecommunication
sites now use a mix of batteries, mobile generators, and fixed-location generators. Typically,
these have 4 to 72 hours of backup power available on-site and thus will depend on
either the resumption of electrical utility power or fuel deliveries to function for longer
periods of time. A short-term electric power grid outage (less than a few days) would not
cause a significant loss of telecom services due to the existence of power backup systems
and best practices supporting these critical systems.
In the case of high amplitude E1 EMP level exposures, spikes in call traffic, coupled
with a mix of transient impacts and damage requiring manual network equipment restoration,
will result in degraded landline and cellular communications on the order of days
to weeks. As in the case of low E1 levels, longer-term impacts from power outages could
extend the period and severity of the degradation.
General results from the Commission’s EMP analysis received concurrence from the
NCS as noted below.

􀂋􀂋
Senate Testimony (March 2005)
In March 2005 testimony before a U.S. Senate subcommittee (Terrorism and the EMP Threat to Homeland
Security, Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Homeland Security, March 8, 2005), the Acting Director of
the NCS noted that “Just last year, the NCS also actively participated in the congressionally-chartered Commission
to Assess the Threat from High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (the 2004 EMP Commission) that examined and
evaluated the state of the EMP threat at present and looking 15 years into the foreseeable future. The Commission’s
Report, delivered last July, concludes that EMP presents a less significant direct threat to telecommunications than
it does to the National Power grid but would nevertheless disrupt or damage a functionally significant fraction of
the electronic circuits in the Nation’s telecommunications systems in the region exposed to EMP (which could
include most of the United States). The NCS concurs with this assessment.”
Analysis Approach
To estimate the impact of an EMP attack on the civilian telecommunications network,
the following major tasks were performed:
􀂋 Reviewed lessons learned with respect to telecommunications critical dependencies
and susceptibilities from past studies of events, such as major disasters and Year 2000
(Y2K).
􀂋 Visited telecommunications facilities to get “ground truth” insights into possible areas
of EMP susceptibility and for data such as equipment layouts to support illustrative
testing of telecommunications equipment.
􀂋 Reviewed past test data and performed illustrative testing of wireline and cellular communications
devices such as cell phones and network equipment such as network
routers to determine EMP susceptibilities.
􀂋 Developed models of telephone network restoration processes and network call
processing associated with alternative EMP scenarios using subject matter expert
judgment, illustrative test data, and augmentation of existing models to estimate degradation
levels for networks. Network statistics such as call completion levels used to
estimate degradation were generated for users, assuming they were not using NS/EP
services such as GETS.
Analysis Approach—Lessons Learned
From interviews and reviews of lessons learned from past outage events, the following
issues were identified that helped shape Commission recommendations and provided
input for the testing and modeling activities:
􀂋 Y2K contingency planning and past outage events, such as the Hurricane Katrina
blackout, point to the need for a functioning voice communications network in an
emergency situation to support restoration efforts for multiple critical infrastructures.
For example, with respect to managing the power grid, reference material associated
with Y2K preparations noted, “The principal strategy is to operate using a manual
transfer of a minimum set of critical information … electric systems must provide sufficient
redundancy to assure voice communications over a geographic area that
addresses its critical facilities and interfaces to neighboring systems and regional
centers.”5
􀂋 Conditions that would lead to multi-day unavailability of power remain a principal
concern of telecommunications providers. Extended power outages will exacerbate
attempts to repair damage and lead to fuel shortages that end up taking network
capacity off-line. This concern was reinforced by Hurricane Katrina and by the August

2003 Northeast Power Outage. The latter was a key topic of the August 27, 2003,
NRIC meeting.
􀂋 A high level of call attempts on both wireline and wireless networks will follow an
EMP attack, thereby reducing the effectiveness of voice communications for some
time period. At least four times the normal call traffic will likely be experienced by
these networks. In previous disasters, these high levels generally lasted for 4 to 8 hours
and remained slightly elevated for the first 12 to 24 hours after the event. The spike in
call volumes results in callers experiencing problems in successful call completion.
Additionally, callers may experience conditions such as delayed dial tones or “all circuits
busy” announcements. As an example, the high blocking levels experienced by
callers on cellular networks on September 11, 2001, in Washington, D.C., and New
York City are shown in figure 3-2 as call attempts rose to levels as high as 12 times
normal.6

􀂋 As previously noted, concerns over the ability of key personnel to get calls through the
public telecommunications network in a disaster was one of the catalysts for services
development that occurred under the leadership of the NCS. GETS and WPS are
services intended for use in emergency conditions to improve the probability of key
personnel completing calls even when wireline and wireless network are under
extremely heavy call loads. These services will be leveraged during an EMP event, but
their benefits for subscribers are mitigated when local equipment requires manual
recovery to be functional. Based on test results, this manual recovery requirement for
cellular base stations is of particular concern.
􀂋 Maintenance and control functions will be critical to restoration and recovery efforts,
as they are used by telecommunications carriers to alleviate the overload conditions
and identify areas of damage within the network to hasten recovery efforts. For the
general populace without access to NS/EP services, if massive call attempts tie up
network resources there would be minimal circuits available to dial out and potentially
reduced capability to reach 9-1-1 services. To help alleviate this, personnel in a Network
Management Center (see figure 3-3) could issue a command to the carrier network
for “call gapping” through a few quick keystrokes on a personal computer.
Through this command, some percentage of calls would be stopped at the originating

switch and thus free up resources that would be needed for dialing out. Testing conducted
as part of the previously referenced NCS-sponsored assessment indicated that
some physical damage to circuit switch components linking to these network management
facilities would occur, even at very low transient levels. This damage would
reduce the ability of recovery efforts to bring systems up to full capacity and affect the
ability to remotely implement procedures to address EMP-induced network problems.
Analysis Approach—Collecting Ground Truth
Prior to conducting testing on equipment, visits were made to carrier facilities to verify
some of the assumptions regarding equipment layouts that were used in the test configurations.
Sites containing wireline network switching and transport equipment, cellular
network switching and transport equipment, and Network Management Center equipment
were visited. Features such as cable lengths and bonding and grounding practices and
issues such as policies for stockpiling spares were explored during these visits. In addition,
discussions were held with personnel involved in telecommunications equipment
installation activities, technical requirements development for electromagnetic effects
protection, and network monitoring and control activities to vet assumptions made in the
equipment testing and modeling activities. Figure 3-4 shows cellular network base station
equipment photographed during one of the visits.
Figure 3-5 is a photo of router equipment used to collect performance information
from carrier equipment and transmit it to a Network Management Center, such as the one
in figure 3-3.
Based on the collected data, a process for network restoration was developed considering
the wide mix of assets that could be affected in an EMP event. The restoration process
was reviewed with experts who had been involved in large restoration efforts,
including personnel charged with developing software systems to expedite network
recovery. These reviews helped augment the restoration process model. This process was
used in developing recovery timelines generated in the modeling and simulation activity.

Analysis Approach—Testing for EMP Effects on Telecommunications Networks
Using the lessons learned and ground truth data described previously, a test plan was
developed that focused most heavily on the effects of EMP on voice communications and
the associated maintenance and control networks that would support recovery and restoration
efforts. Consistent with this, testing activities focused on communications devices
and switching and routing equipment expected to play a critical role in supporting future
voice communications and on computing equipment supporting the collection of data
used for network traffic management. E1 was considered as the primary source of EMP
effects on carrier equipment under the assumption that long transport lines within carrier
telecommunications networks have moved to fiber instead of copper. We also recognized
the growing use of fiber within close proximity to home and business establishments. In
accordance with these assumptions, the communications carrier network equipment testing
focused on assets that would be considered part of the local nodes in figure 3-1.
Prior test data on digital switches, routers, computers, and related equipment were
reviewed. For example, during the 1980s and early 1990s, the NCS sponsored testing on
major telecommunications switches and transport equipment. The test effort conducted
on behalf of the EMP Commission was designed to complement the data available in
previously discussed NCS technical reports and other data sources. The test data provided
information on the behavior of particular pieces of equipment and was subsequently used
to model the impact of an EMP attack on the telecommunications network infrastructure
and the recovery process. In addition to network equipment, CPE such as basic telephones
and cell phones were tested, as the level of traffic on the public telecommunications
networks would be affected by the CPE’s EMP survivability. Table 3-1 lists the
telecommunications assets tested at multiple government and commercial facilities,
including a rationale for why they were selected. A mixture of continuous wave immersion
(CWI), pulse current injection (PCI), and free field illumination tests was used. Figure
3-6 depicts testing that was conducted at a cellular base station at Idaho National
Laboratory (INL). Free-field illumination testing was conducted on equipment covering
each of the areas in table 3-1 (except for cellular network carrier switching equipment
[see figure 3-6]). The equipment tested included a softswitch, cordless phones, cellular
phones, computing servers, Ethernet switches, and routers.
During the testing, in cases where impacts were observed, some were transient in
nature, for example, auto-rebooting of softswitch equipment, while some testing resulted
in permanent equipment damage and required manual recovery via replacement of components
(for example Ethernet card replacement) to address performance degradation.

Analysis Approach—Modeling and Simulation of EMP Effects
To develop a view of the system effects that would be caused by an EMP attack, a systematic
approach was used in the modeling and simulation effort. The analysis leveraged
the Commission-sponsored testing just described, as well as prior equipment testing
results. Initially, a telecommunications network performance modeling approach for generating
call completion levels given degradation assumptions in wireline and wireless
networks was developed for the continental United States. The major assumption in this
modeling was that the key area of degradation would be local nodes in the carrier networks
(for both wireline and cellular networks). As shown in figure 3-1, local nodes are
equipment such as the digital circuit switches and cellular base station equipment that
provide callers with entry into these wireline and cellular telecommunications networks.
Impacts on local nodes could inhibit local calls, as well as prohibit connections to the
backbone network that provides for more geographically dispersed communications.
Positive trends in the direction of EMP survivability for backbone communications are
due to increased routing diversity coupled with heavy fiber deployment, suggesting that a
local focus is reasonable in terms of first-order effects.
Following this logic, the modeling steps included:
1. Generate a case study using weapons detonation scenarios that produce electromagnetic
field levels modeled over selected geographic regions of the United States and
model the impact on network performance (e.g., call completion levels) given the
degree of network upset expected to be caused initially by the EMP event. We
included transient or self-correcting effects and effects that require human action to
correct. The model incorporated past test results from NCS studies and new testing of
the equipment listed in table 3-1, using assumptions about the types and configurations
of equipment that would be deployed in affected areas. The starting point for
equipment types was industry databases identifying equipment deployed in telecommunications
networks. This was augmented with subject matter expert discussions.
2. Apply generic methods and procedures incorporated in the network restoration process
noted earlier to generate recovery times for network equipment. Inputs include
engineering assumptions on equipment damage levels, availability of repair personnel,
availability of network management and control functions, availability of electric
power, and other factors.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 3. Telecommunications
76
3. Use the recovery times to model placing equipment back in service and iteratively
estimate network performance levels over time using the network performance
model.
The following are illustrative results generated from among scenarios of interest identified
by the Commission. Figures 3-9 through 3-11 show originating call completion
levels in the eastern United States for the average combined wireline and wireless calls
after an EMP event. Time period categories in these figures include immediately following,
4 hours after, and 48 hours after the EMP event. The results displayed incorporate
longer restoration times for cellular equipment, driven in part by levels of manual
recovery. Figure 3-12 shows the recovery curve during the 10-day period following the
attack. This is the estimated time period to regain pre-event performance, absent other
infrastructure interdependency impacts such as long-term power outages. The shaded
circles indicate EMP field-level isocontours generated by the weapon. For example, in
figure 3-9, the geographic area most negatively impacted has estimated call completion
levels of roughly only 4 percent, while the area outside the range of the direct effects has
a 73 percent call completion level estimate.
The reason for the 73 percent level is that callers outside the directly affected areas are
unable to make calls into the affected areas due to equipment disruptions in those areas,
coupled with network congestion and high call-retry levels.

The illustrative results in figure 3-12 highlight the value of operational GETS and WPS
capabilities given that the call completion levels noted in figure 3-12 would be unacceptable
for NS/EP functions during the critical early stages of an emergency. The analysis
performed as part of this EMP Commission effort did not explicitly examine the performance
of these NS/EP services in an EMP attack. The call completion levels in figure
3-12 would be seen as likely lower bounds for these services for the scenarios of interest
examined.

The scenarios examined indicated that even in the case of minimal equipment damage,
the functioning of NS/EP telecommunications services are critical to handling the spike
in caller traffic expected to follow an EMP attack. This traffic tends to overwhelm the
available telecom network capacity and results in degraded network performance. While
operational experience exists with the current technologies that support NS/EP services,
there is the need to make sure that NS/EP services operate effectively as new technoloCRITICAL

gies, such as softswitches, are being introduced into the network. It is important to verify
that this equipment will operate through an EMP attack under the stressful operating conditions
that are anticipated in an emergency situation. The use of IP-related technology
such as softswitches to support GETS and WPS services is at the initial point of deployment
in local offices. Rigorous analysis is warranted prior to their major deployment to
examine EMP survivability issues.
During sensitivity analysis, in the process of examining alternative cellular base station
damage levels, an area of concern was identified within the cellular network system. Specifically,
the area of concern was degradation of network performance due to EMP
effects on critical databases, including the Home Location Registers (HLRs). HLRs contain
key user information associated with cellular subscribers, such as account status and
location. Within the wireless industry, the deployment approach to achieve HLR diversity
(physical and geographic) is mixed. HLRs were not tested for susceptibility levels as part
of the EMP Commission study, but using proxy numbers based on testing for circuit
switching equipment, sensitivity studies show that it is possible to lose major calling
areas in an EMP attack due to HLR degradation. In addition to EMP susceptibility testing,
engineering polices and selective EMP hardening of these elements are options that
should be examined in the future.
As noted in the Electric Power chapter, loss of portions of the power grid is likely, even
for a relatively low-level EMP attack. Our analysis indicates that, in a relatively low-level
EMP attack, the direct impact on public telecommunications networks is likely to be
dominated by the inability to handle ensuing spikes in call traffic. In such cases, the
direct effects on equipment are expected to be largely transient and short term in nature
(minutes to hours) with minimal manual restoration needed. However, should widespread
loss of primary power occur, the survivability of the telecommunications network and
associated NS/EP and other services will depend on the use of backup power capabilities
and the rapidity with which primary power can be restored. Most public telecommunications
equipment has a mix of battery, mobile generator, and fixed generator support if
primary electric power is lost. A short-term loss of the electric power supporting most
telecommunications networks today would not cause a major loss of telecom services.
This is due to the existence of power backup systems and best practices supporting these
critical systems that could sustain telecom services during short-term power outages.
The situation becomes more serious if the power outages are long term and widespread.
In such cases, the likely loss of major telecommunications facilities would significantly
reduce NS/EP services. A majority of residential telephones today depend on power from
local central offices, which would be lost once the backup power at those offices is
depleted. Other residential telephones also require commercial power to function. Thus,
citizen ability to access 9-1-1 call centers would be a major concern in an extended power
outage situation.
Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 damaged cell phone towers and radio antennas. The
prolonged blackout resulting from Katrina exhausted the fuel supplies of backup generators
servicing emergency communications. Consequently, emergency communications
for police, emergency services, and rescue efforts failed. Significantly, these same nodes
so critical to emergency communications—cell phone towers and radio antennas—are
vulnerable to EMP attack. A protracted blackout resulting from an EMP attack would
also exhaust fuel supplies for emergency generators, just as occurred during Hurricane
Katrina.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 3. Telecommunications
79
Public telecommunications networks can successfully handle a local power outage or
short-term outage, such as the August 14, 2003, Northeast blackout. However, a major
concern exists with outage durations that range in weeks or months. The widespread
collapse of the electric grid due to an EMP event would lead to cascading effects on
interdependent infrastructures, as happened during the Katrina blackout. This may well
lead to a long-term loss of telecommunications in extended geographic areas outside the
power loss. This loss would cascade to any critical applications that depend on
telecommunications. As such, telecommunications resilience would greatly benefit from
steps to increase power grid and backup power reliability and availability time frames.
Telecommunications network managers have indicated that a key asset in any outage
event is the ability to monitor the health of the network in real time to enable rapid
response to identified problems. Given the increased level of automation in telecommunications
networks coupled with reduction in personnel, it is critical that the telecommunications
operations and control functions remain operational in an EMP event. In recovering
from an EMP attack, telecommunications carriers will depend on hardware and
software systems that help isolate problem areas and implement commands to initiate
remediation efforts. Computer servers, personal computers, routers, and related equipment
are key components that are housed in Network Management Centers. Carriers
typically deploy the equipment in geographically diverse centers in which one center can
back up the others. Effects to those centers are moderated in cases in which the centers
are separated by distances larger than the EMP footprint.
Recommendations
Based on the analytical efforts performed by this Commission, the following steps are
recommended to improve telecommunications performance during and after an EMP
event:
􀂋 Successfully evolve critical NS/EP telecommunications services to incorporate the
new technologies being embedded into telecommunications networks.
􀂋 Improve the ability of telecommunications services to function for extended periods
without the availability of primary power.
􀂋 Adequately address infrastructure interdependency impacts in contingency planning.
􀂋 Identify critical applications that must survive an EMP event and address any shortfalls
in telecommunications services that support these applications.
These recommendations are discussed in more detail in the next few sections.
Preventing Widespread Outages from New Technology
EMP is just one of the potential sources that would lead to stressing telecommunications
networks. Understanding NS/EP service performance with respect to IP technology
has benefits beyond application to EMP. This issue is in line with a U.S. government
interagency Convergence Working Group (CWG) finding7 that noted, “The FCC should
task NRIC to assess the adequacy of interoperability testing between circuit and packet
switch networks … minimize the risk of feature interactions and the introduction of additional
vulnerabilities affecting reliability, availability, and security of telecommunication
services supporting NS/EP users.”

High-profile network failures have occurred as new technologies were introduced into
networks. Inadequate testing prior to widespread deployment has been highlighted as a
major problem in lessons learned from past outages related to new technology introduction.
8 These offer an incentive for the testing of new technology supporting NS/EP services
prior to widespread deployment of the technologies. The use of packet switching
technology to support voice services such as GETS and WPS is at the initial point of
deployment. Rigorous testing is warranted prior to major deployment. With early identification,
specific system EMP vulnerabilities can be addressed prior to widespread
deployment.
The following are specific steps to address technology introduction concerns:
􀂋 NCS9 represents a logical organization to address these areas given its mission
associated with the development and maintenance of NS/EP services. NCS should
partner with other appropriate organizations to determine the effects of EMP on
different types of telecommunications equipment, facilities, and operations by:
— The testing and analysis of new technologies introduced into telecommunications
networks that will support NS/EP services prior to widespread introduction into the
public network. IP-related equipment should be a major near-term focus of this
testing and analysis. This analysis should include examining the use of standards in
terms of prevention and mitigation benefits.
— Capturing the lessons learned from future outages associated with the expected
growth of voice communications by nontraditional carriers and the tremendous
growth in wireless communications. It is important that such lessons learned be
captured in a systematic and fiscally prudent manner.
Historically, data captured by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on
major outages has been extremely valuable in identifying and correcting problems as they
are exhibited in deployed systems. Again, this is consistent with the EMP Commission’s
philosophy of preventing disastrous consequences from “cheap shot” attacks.
Reducing the Effects of Power Outages on the Telecommunications
Infrastructure
In a power outage, telecommunications carriers typically depend on battery supplies
that last from 4 to 8 hours and in some cases fixed and mobile generators that may have
up to 72 hours of operating fuel. A key concern is the potential that major telecommunications
facilities may not have primary power in the event of a long-term power outage of
several weeks over a wide geographic area. Among the major concerns in such events
are:
􀂋 The potential that major telecommunications facilities will not have prioritized access
to fuel supplies on a long-term basis in the event of a long-term, wide-scale power
outage.
􀂋 Facilities running on backup generators on a long-term basis will eventually require
maintenance.

These concerns proved prescient when Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005.
Katrina caused a prolonged blackout that resulted in telecommunications failures
precisely because of the above concerns regarding fuel supplies and maintenance for
emergency generators.
After the August 2003 Northeast blackout, recommendations were put forward by the
NRIC to help address this power dependency issue. As part of lessons learned discussed
in an August 27, 2003, NRIC presentation on the impact of the 2003 Northeast blackout,
telecom-specific references were made to re-evaluate the Telecommunications Electric
Service Priority (TESP) program: “Power management and restoral practices at the
tactical level are under review by carriers—may need modifications to the TESP program
to mitigate additional risks,” and “Development of TESP program for cellular networks
to address priority restoration of critical cellular communications facilities is needed.”10
TESP promotes (on a voluntary basis) the inclusion of critical telecommunications
facilities in electric service providers’ priority restoration plans.11
Lessons learned from Katrina and the NRIC evaluation of the 2003 Northeast blackout
form the underpinning for the following EMP Commission recommendations:
􀂋 Improve the ability of telecommunications to withstand the sustained loss of utilitysupplied
electric power:
— Task the NCS and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), or
its successor, with providing, at a minimum, biannual status reports on the need
for/adequacy of priority restoration of electric power by power utilities to selected
telecommunications sites.
— Task the Department of Energy (DOE) with exploring the adequacy of financial
incentives to spur analysis of alternative powering sources that offer cost-effective
and viable alternatives for telecom asset powering. For example, carriers are
exploring new technologies such as fuel cells to support the powering of offices.
Adequately Addressing Interdependency Impacts in Contingency Planning
The potential impact of other interdependency effects, with a priority on NS/EP services,
must be considered in any analysis of recovery planning. For example, the
assumption of key personnel access to transportation to operations center sites or remote
access to equipment should be addressed in contingency planning. With this in mind, the
NCS would be a logical organization to address this area for critical national infrastructures.
Specifically, the Commission recommends the following:
􀂋 Expand the role of the NCS within the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 215
(Federal Focal Point for EMP Information) to address infrastructure interdependencies
related to NS/EP telecommunications services.
Supporting this recommendation is the need to exercise the National Response
Framework to determine how well the plan addresses simultaneous degradation of multiple
infrastructures. Industry personnel have suggested to the EMP Commission that a
tabletop exercise considering this type of scenario would be extremely useful. Exercise
results should be factored into the development of an EMP scenario to be included on the
DHS list of National Planning Scenarios. Such an exercise would be invaluable in

understanding the impacts of telecommunications failures on other infrastructure sectors
and vice versa. Of particular concern is the impact of losing telecommunications on the
operating effectiveness of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
for infrastructures such as electric power and natural gas.
Specifically, the Commission recommends the following:

incorporating a large-scale degradation for multiple infrastructures over a wide geographic
area as might occur in an EMP event.
Improving the Ability of Telecommunications Networks That Support

and Conducting Vulnerability Assessments
The Commission recommends the following:
􀂋 Task NCS to identify key telecommunications network assets whose degradation can
result in the loss of service to a large number of users. These might include nextgeneration
routing and transport equipment and wireless network elements such as
HLRs and Visiting Location Registers (VLRs). Cellular base stations should be part of
this analysis.
􀂋 Task NCS through DHS, in accordance with the CFR for Telecommunications
Electromagnetic Disruptive Effects (TEDE) affecting NS/EP telecommunications, to
work with government and multiple industries (e.g., Federal Reserve Board and BITS
[financial services], Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] and NERC
[electric power], and DHS and first responders [civilian restoration]) to determine
whether a high-reliability telecommunications service or services supporting missioncritical
applications is needed. If so, consider partial federal funding for this service.
􀂋 Establish a reporting process to be developed by the FCC, NCS, and the telecommunications
industry for reporting major outages from wireless, data communications,
and Internet carriers to the FCC, analogous to what is done for wireline carriers,
thereby capturing lessons learned.

Chapter 4. Banking and Finance
Introduction
The financial services industry comprises a network of organizations and attendant
systems that process instruments of monetary value in the form of deposits, funds transfers,
savings, loans, and other financial transactions. Virtually all economic activity in the
United States (U.S.) and other developed countries depends on the functioning of the
financial services industry. National wealth is the sum of all economic value, as reflected
in part in existing capital and financial transactions. Most simply, the financial services
industry is the medium and record keeper for financial transactions and repository of
national, organizational, and individual wealth.
Today, most significant financial transactions are performed and recorded electronically;
however, the ability to carry out these transactions is highly dependent on other
elements of the national infrastructure. According to the President’s National Security
Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), “The financial services industry
has evolved to a point where it would be impossible to operate without the efficiencies of
information technology and networks.”1
The automation of the financial services industry has spurred the growth of wealth by
increasing greatly the amount of business that can be conducted on a daily basis. For
example, “in the early 1970s, the New York Stock Exchange [NYSE] closed every
Wednesday to clear backlogs from an average daily trading volume of 11 million
shares.”2 Today, the Securities Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC) has no interruption
in exchange operations and routinely handles an average daily trading volume of
more than 3 billion shares.3
“SIAC is responsible for providing the highest quality, most reliable and cost-effective
systems to support the current and future business needs of the New York Stock
Exchange”4 and other institutions. “SIAC’s Shared Data Center alone is linked to the
securities industry by more than a thousand communications lines over which an average
of 70 billion bytes of data is transmitted daily.”5 SIAC’s Secure Financial Transaction
Infrastructure, “improves the overall resilience of the financial industry’s data communications
connectivity…and offers firms reliable access to… trading, clearing and settlement,
market data distribution, and other services.”6
The technological revolution has not been limited to giant corporations. The individual
consumer has witnessed the growth of convenient, on-demand money-dispensing

more than 371,000 in 2003.8
The trend in the U.S. financial infrastructure is toward ever more sophisticated and
powerful electronic systems capable of an ever increasing volume and velocity of business.
The increasing dependence of the United States on an electronic economy, so beneficial
to the management and creation of wealth, also increases U.S. vulnerability to an
electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack.
For example, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, demonstrated the vulnerabilities
arising from the significant interdependencies of the Nation’s critical infrastructures.
The attacks disrupted all critical infrastructures in New York City, including power,
transportation, and telecommunications. Consequently, operations in key financial markets
were interrupted, increasing liquidity risks for the U.S. financial system.9
An interagency paper jointly issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC), the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), and the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), specifies clearing and settlement systems as the most critical business operations
at risk for financial markets.10 Because financial markets are highly interdependent, a
wide-scale disruption of core clearing and settlement processes would have an immediate
systemic effect on critical financial markets.11
Moreover, in December 2002, the FRB revised its policy and procedures for national
security and emergency preparedness telecommunications programs administered by the
National Communications System (NCS) to identify those functions supporting the Federal
Reserve’s national security mission to maintain national liquidity.12 The FRB
expanded the scope of services that would seriously affect continued financial operations
if a telecommunications disruption of “a few minutes to one day” occurred.13 These functions,
which are listed below, “require same-day recovery and are critical to the operations
and liquidity of banks and the stability of financial markets”:14

􀂋 Large-dollar participants of these systems and utilities.15
The increasing dependence of the United States on an electronic economy also adds to
the adverse effects that would be produced by an EMP attack. The electronic technologies
that are the foundation of the financial infrastructure are potentially vulnerable to
EMP. These systems are also potentially vulnerable to EMP indirectly through other
critical infrastructures, such as the electric power grid and telecommunications.
The Financial Services Industry
In a December 1997 study, Financial Services Risk Assessment Report, NSTAC
described the financial services industry as comprising four sectors. This definition is
reflected or shared in current U.S. government reports, regulations, and legislation that
treat the financial services industry as having these components:
􀂋 Banks and other depository institutions
􀂋 Investment-related companies
􀂋 Industry utilities
􀂋 Third-party processors and other services.
Banks and Other Depository Institutions. In 2004, U.S. banks held more than $9 trillion16
of domestic financial assets, and investment companies and other private institutions
held about $17 trillion of the national wealth.17 Banks and other depository institutions,
including thrifts, credit unions, and savings and loan associations, are vital to the
functioning of the economy. These institutions hold and provide access to deposits, provide
loans, transfer funds, promote savings, and facilitate economic growth.
Commercial banks are the repository of the most financial assets of any depository
institution. Commercial banks disseminate financial information, act as agents in buying
and selling securities, serve as trustees for corporations or individuals, transfer funds,
collect deposits, and provide credit. The top 10 commercial banks control nearly half of
all assets held by banks.18
Credit unions, savings and loan associations, and savings banks generally are referred
to as “other depository institutions.” These institutions usually service households instead
of businesses. Credit unions are the most financially significant of these institutions. By
the end of 2004, credit unions had more than 85 million members and managed more
than $668 billion in assets.19
The single most important banking institution is the Federal Reserve System. Established
by the U.S. Congress in 1913, the Federal Reserve System is the central bank of
the United States. This system does not deal directly with the general public, but with
other banks. It is, in essence, the Nation’s bank for commercial banks.
The primary purpose of the Federal Reserve System is to maintain the stability, safety,
and flexibility of the financial system and contain systemic risk that may arise in the

financial markets. The Federal Reserve accomplishes this mission by establishing monetary
policy, by servicing financial institutions and other government agencies, and by
regulating and supervising banks.
As the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve System extends emergency
credit to commercial banks and controls interest rates, foreign exchange, and the
money supply. The Federal Reserve also performs check-clearing and processing and
transfer of government securities and funds between financial institutions.
Federal Reserve System banks are supervised by a Board of Governors who are
appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate; however, the banks are
owned by private member banks. For administrative purposes, the United States is
divided into 12 Federal Reserve Districts, each district served by a Federal Reserve Bank.
The 12 Federal Reserve Banks are located in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond,
Atlanta, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, Minneapolis, and San
Francisco.
Investment-Related Companies. Unlike commercial banks, underwriters, brokerages,
and mutual funds are not depository institutions. Rather, these institutions provide a wide
range of services to institutional and individual investors. They act as intermediaries in
pooling investments by a large group of customers and in market trades.
Investment banks and underwriters finance investments by government and commercial
enterprises through stocks and bonds. Investment banks also arrange mergers. Currently,
the largest 50 firms hold 90 percent of the market share.20
Brokerages help investors by acting as agents or intermediaries with commodities and
securities markets. Brokerages advise clients, perform research, and place trades. “The
securities brokerage industry in the United States includes fewer than 400 companies
with combined annual revenue of over $100 billion. The top 50 companies hold over 80
percent of the market share.”21
Mutual funds pool money from many people and institutions and invest it in stocks,
bonds, or other securities. A portfolio manager is employed by the mutual fund to achieve
its financial objective, such as providing a reliable source of investment income or maximizing
long-term returns. The mutual fund market is dominated by 25 companies. The
top five companies hold one-third of the market. The mutual fund industry holds about
$8.1 trillion dollars in assets.22
Industry Utilities. Banks, including the Federal Reserve System, and investment-related
companies, such as investment banks, brokerages, and mutual funds, all rely on industry
utilities to transact business. Financial service utilities are the institutions that provide a
common means for transferring, clearing, and settling funds, securities, and other financial
instruments, as well as exchanging financial information.
Financial industry utilities have largely replaced paper transactions with electronic
means. Check and cash transactions are still the largest number of financial transactions
in the national economy. However, paper transactions are vastly surpassed in total value

by electronic transactions through wire transfers, interbank payment systems, ACHs, and
clearing and settlement systems for securities and other investments.
Modern financial services utilities have transformed the national economy from a paper
system into an electronic system. Examples of some key industry utilities include FEDNET,
Fedwire, ACH, Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), the Society
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), the National Association
of Securities Dealers’ Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ), the NYSE, the
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation
(DTCC).
FEDNET is a communications system connecting all 12 Federal Reserve Banks
nationwide and the financial services industry generally. FEDNET transfers funds in real
time among banks and other depository institutions, performs real-time sales and record
keeping for the transfer of government securities, and serves as ACH.
Fedwire is the primary national network for the transfer of funds between banks; the
system currently serves approximately 7,500 institutions. Fedwire’s book-entry securities
transfer application allows banks and other depository institutions to transfer U.S. government
securities. This network has enabled the Federal Reserve to largely replace paper
U.S. government securities with electronic book entries. Transfers performed on Fedwire
are irrevocable upon receipt and are settled immediately. The average value of a Fedwire
funds transaction is about $3.9 million dollars.23 In 2005, Fedwire processed an average
daily volume of approximately 528,000 payments, with an average daily value of about
$2.1 trillion.24
ACH was developed in the 1970s as an alternative to the traditional paper-based system
for clearing checks. ACH electronic transactions include direct deposits of payrolls, pensions,
benefits, and dividends and direct bill payments. The Federal Reserve annually
processes about 36.7 billion ACH payments valued at $39.9 trillion dollars.25
CHIPS is an electronic system for interbank transfer and settlement. CHIPS is the primary
clearing system for foreign exchange. “It processes over 285,000 payments a day
with a gross value of $1.4 trillion.” This includes 95 percent of all international U.S. dollar
payments.26
The SWIFT provides stock exchanges, banks, brokers, and other institutions with a
cost-effective, secure international payment message system. These messages are
instructions between banks and other institutions regarding payments and transfers, not
payments themselves. SWIFT carries approximately 8 million messages daily.27
The NASDAQ and the NYSE are the largest securities markets. NASDAQ is an electronic
communications network that consolidates the quotations of multiple dealers, displayed
in real time, and allows electronic trading. The NYSE offers similar electronic

services. NASDAQ executed 957.9 million trades valued at more than $3.7 trillion dollars
in 2004, and the NYSE traded a slightly lesser amount.28
The NYMEX trades on futures contracts such as unleaded gasoline, heating oil, crude
oil, natural gas, and platinum. NYMEX typically conducts crude oil transactions involving
the total daily production of the entire world.
The DTCC settles securities trades for participant banks and is the largest securities
depositary in the world. In 2004, the company completed financial settlement for a quadrillion
dollars in securities transactions. DTCC keeps records on securities and conducts
transactions electronically. Annually, DTCC participants deliver securities valued at
about $4.5 trillion to DTCC to make electronic records of ownership.29
Third-Party Processors and Other Services. Third-party processing companies are
technology companies that provide electronic processing services to financial institutions.
Banks and other financial institutions can cut overhead by contracting with third parties
to perform the mechanics of electronic transactions. Technology-related outsourcing is
especially appealing because of dynamic changes in technology. The high cost and complexity
of new technologies has driven many banks into partnerships with third-party
specialists in the field of electronic finance. Services typically offered by third-party
processors include data center management, network management, application development,
check and statement processing, mutual fund account processing, and electronic
funds transfer.
Vulnerability to EMP
The financial infrastructure is highly dependent on electronic systems, which should be
clear from the preceding discussion. Virtually all transactions involving banks and other
financial institutions happen electronically. Virtually all record keeping of financial
transactions are stored electronically. Just as paper money has replaced precious metals,
so an electronic economy has replaced the paper one. The financial infrastructure is a
network of simple and complex electronic machinery, ranging from telephones to mainframe
computers, from ATMs to vast data storage systems.
The electronic technologies that are the foundation of the financial infrastructure are
potentially vulnerable to EMP. These systems also are potentially vulnerable to EMP
indirectly through other critical infrastructures, such as the power grid and
telecommunications.
The financial services industry and knowledgeable experts on the security of that
industry judge that the industry is highly robust against a wide range of threats. The
NSTAC, for example, notes that the leading financial institutions take a multilayered
approach to building robustness and recoverability into their systems:
Operational data centers are engineered from the ground up
with survivability in mind. Some are hardened with thick concrete
walls and protected with extensive perimeter security
measures equivalent to military command posts. Most have
uninterruptible power supplies, generators, and on-site fuel

storage sufficient to allow the facility to run independently of
the power grid ranging from a few hours to over a month.
External telecommunications links are diversely homed, with
multiple building access points and connections to more than
one central office…wherever possible. Operational procedures
within the data center are designed to minimize the risk of
human errors causing interruptions, and most or all data files
are copied and stored on disk or tape at off-site facilities.30
NSTAC also observes that, “Numerous natural and man-made disasters…have forced
financial institutions to test and refine their disaster recovery capabilities.”31 The financial
services industry’s dependence on other infrastructures has been tested in real emergencies.
For example, in 1988, a fire in the Ameritech central office in Hinsdale, Illinois, disabled
long-distance telecommunications for the Chicago Board of Trade and other major
institutions. Wall Street was blacked out for nearly a week by an electrical fire in a Consolidated
Edison office in August 1990. In April 1992, underground flooding in Chicago
caused sustained telecommunication and power outages. Financial institutions faced
widespread electrical power outages in the West during the summer of 1996 and in the
Northeast during the summer of 2003.
“In addition,” according to NSTAC, “the industry weathered one of the worst terrorist
attacks in recent history”:
The World Trade Center bombing on February 26, 1993,
struck at the industry’s heart, affecting the New York Mercantile
Exchange and many securities dealers and otherwise disrupting
activities throughout Wall Street. Numerous problems
with facilities, systems, procedures, and staffs were encountered
as firms scurried to recover, and some securities firms’
operations were shut down temporarily. However, none of the
most critical services were affected, and the effect on the economy
as a whole was minimal.32
The financial services industry also weathered the more devastating terrorist attack on
September 11, 2001, that destroyed the World Trade Center. NSTAC found that these
types of events, “led to improved robustness of the financial services infrastructure.”
NSTAC’s judgment that the financial services industry enjoys robust survivability
against a wide range of threats is seconded by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)
in its study, Making the Nation Safer: The Role of Science and Technology in Countering
Terrorism (2002). According to the NAS, the U.S. financial infrastructure is highly
secure because of the redundancy of its electronic systems: “While no law of physics
prevents the simultaneous destruction of all data backups and backup facilities in all
locations, such an attack would be highly complex and difficult to execute, and is thus
implausible.”33

Chapter 4. Banking and Finance
90
However, the NSTAC and NAS studies were focused primarily on the threat to the
financial services industry from cyberterrorists using computer-based attacks. These
studies did not evaluate the threat from EMP attack.
An EMP attack would pose the very kind of simultaneous and widespread threat postulated
by the NAS that would be fatal to the financial infrastructure but judged by them
to be too difficult to execute and implausible for cyberterrorists. EMP effects propagate at
the speed of light and would cover a broad geographic area. Such an attack potentially
could achieve the NAS criteria for financial infrastructure catastrophe: “simultaneous
destruction of all data backups and backup facilities in all locations.”34
An EMP would probably not erase data stored on magnetic tape. However, by shutting
down power grids and damaging or disrupting data retrieval systems, EMP could deny
access to essential records stored on tapes and compact discs (CD). Moreover, because
EMP physically destroys electronic systems, it is also in the category of threats that
NSTAC concludes are more worrisome than cyberterrorism: “Physical attacks remain the
larger risk for the industry.”
The vast majority of electronic systems supporting the financial infrastructure have
never been tested, let alone hardened, against EMP. Yet the enormous volume, speed, and
accuracy required of the electronic infrastructure supporting the financial services industry
allow little or no room for error. Financial operations could not tolerate the kind of
disruptions or mass systemic destruction likely to follow an EMP attack.
For example, CHIPS interbank transactions typically involve about $1.4 trillion dollars
of business every day, or some $182 billion dollars every hour.35 CHIPS and Fedwire
routinely receive 5 to 10 funds transfer messages each second during peak traffic periods.
36 The Options Clearing Corporation manages $1.05 billion in average daily premium
settlements.37 On Christmas Eve 2004, a single credit card association processed over
5,000 transactions per second.38 Financial institutions also must store tremendous
amounts of data. Terabyte portfolios (containing 1 trillion bytes) are now common, and
some databases exceed a petabyte (1,000 trillion bytes). Changes in these huge databases
must be recorded at the end of every business day.
“Dealing with this kind of volume, industry utilities cannot afford any interruption in
service,” according to NSTAC. An EMP attack, with its potential to disrupt communications
possibly for days, weeks, or months and to destroy or change databases, would
place the financial infrastructure at risk.
Although the financial services industry has survived and learned from natural and
man-made disasters, those disasters also have exposed vulnerabilities that could be
exploited by an EMP attack. According to the staff director for management of the FRB,
the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, on the World Trade Center exposed telecommunications
and the concentration of key facilities as serious weaknesses of the financial

services industry. Equity markets closed for 4 days, until September 15, due to failed
telecommunications. The NYSE could not reopen because key central offices were
destroyed or damaged, leaving them unable to support operations. According to this senior
government official, Fedwire, CHIPS, and SWIFT would cease operation if telecommunications
were disrupted. He further observed that ACH, ATMs, and credit and debit
cards all depend on telecommunications. Disruption of these systems would force consumers
to revert to a cash economy.39
Further, response to the Northeast power outage in August 2003 has been depicted as a
triumph for the financial services industry safeguards implemented since the terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001. But this is not the whole picture. Some analysts observe
that the blackout happened under nearly ideal conditions to facilitate financial industry
recovery. The blackout happened on a Thursday at 4:10 p.m., after the 4:00 p.m. closing
time for financial markets, and it was largely over for the financial industry by 9:00 a.m.
the following Friday morning. Business was also light, at its nadir, as is usual during
August.
Even so, recovery from the 2003 blackout still required many in the financial industry
to work overnight. The American Stock Exchange did not open because its air conditioners
would not operate. Many traders could not get to work on Friday because the transportation
system was paralyzed. Some companies were unable to reach the NASDAQ
electronic exchange by telephone. Many ATMs failed. Many of the 1,667 banks in New
York City closed on Friday because of continuing power outage. Many industries with
back-up generators, like KeyCorp in Cleveland, were unprepared for a blackout that
lasted for more than a few hours, and they had difficulty getting diesel fuel.
The fortunate timing and short duration of the 2003 blackout affected the financial
industry for a relatively brief period. Nonetheless, banks had to compensate for financial
imbalances by borrowing $785 million dollars from the Federal Reserve System. This
was 100 times the amount borrowed the previous week, and the greatest amount borrowed
since the week after the September 11 attacks.40 Most economists concur that the
blackout had a small but measurable effect on the U.S. third-quarter economic growth.
These observations suggest that, if an EMP attack were to disrupt the financial industry
for days, weeks, or months rather than hours, the economic impact would be catastrophic.
The prolonged blackout resulting from Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 is a far better
example than the Northeast blackout of 2003 of the challenge that would be posed to the
financial infrastructure from EMP. The Katrina blackout, comparable to a small EMP
attack, disrupted normal business life for months and resulted in a staggering economic
loss that is still an enormous drain on the national economy.
The financial network is highly dependent on power and telecommunications for normal
operations. Widespread power outages would shut down the network, and all financial
activity would cease until power was restored, as happened during Hurricane Katrina.
Even if power were unaffected or restored in short order, full telecommunications are
required to fully enable the financial network. If critical elements within the telecommunications
infrastructure were negatively affected by the EMP attack (i.e., at main and

local switches), the financial network would be impacted negatively to some degree and
consequently be highly dependent on the telecommunication recovery timelines before it
could be brought back online with the required capability and capacity.
The extent to which the financial network is able to function as it is being brought back
online will be highly dependent on the level of damage incurred by the network as a
result of the EMP attack.
Consequences of Financial Infrastructure Failure
Despite the robustness of U.S. financial infrastructures against a wide range of threats,
they were not designed to withstand an EMP attack. Indeed, the highly sophisticated
electronic technologies that make the modern U.S. financial infrastructure possible are
the components most vulnerable to EMP.
An EMP attack that disrupts the financial services industry would, in effect, stop the
operation of the U.S. economy. Business transactions that create wealth and jobs could
not be performed. Loans for corporate capitalization and for private purposes, such as
buying homes and automobiles could not be made. Wealth, recorded electronically in
bank databases, could become inaccessible overnight. Credit, debit, and ATM cards
would be useless. Even reversion to a cash economy might be difficult in the absence of
electronic records that are the basis of cash withdrawals from banks. Most people keep
their wealth in banks and have little cash on hand at home. The alternative to a disrupted
electronic economy may not be reversion to a 19th century cash economy, but reversion
to an earlier economy based on barter.
In the immediate aftermath of an EMP attack, banks would find it very difficult to
operate and provide the public with the liquidity they require to survive; that is, to buy
food, water, gas, or other essential supplies and services. Modern banking depends almost
entirely on electronic data storage and retrieval systems for record keeping and to perform
account transactions. An EMP attack that damages the power grid or electronic data
retrieval systems would render banking transactions virtually impossible as a practical or
legal matter.
Operating a banking system using paper and handwritten transactions would be difficult
without access to the information contained in electronic records. If a makeshift
paper banking system could be organized on an emergency basis, such a system would be
fraught with the risk of fraud, theft, and costly mistakes. Such a system would not be
consistent with the cautious behavior and natural interest of banks in assigning highest
priority to protecting financial assets. Protocols and business standards that are required
of banks under their charters for insurance purposes and to protect them from legal liability
assume the existence of modern electronic banking systems and the reliability, redundancy,
and surety that such systems provide.
A survey by Commission staff of natural and man-made disasters found no case in
which banks, bereft of their electronic systems because of blackout, reopened their doors
and did business by hand. Unless banks have well-prepared contingency plans in place to
revert to paper and handwritten transactions in advance of a crisis, it is very doubtful that
bank managers would have the capability, authority, or motivation to attempt a paper and
handwritten banking system in the aftermath of an EMP attack. Unless directed by federal
authority to create contingency plans for operating without electricity, it is doubtful
the business community would undertake such plans on its own.

Chapter 4. Banking and Finance

In the aftermath of an EMP attack, individuals and corporations would have many
sound reasons for being cautious, risk averse, and unwilling to resume business as usual.
Once power, telecommunications, and transportation are restored, even if restored
promptly, within a matter of days, psychological concerns that affect economic revitalization
may linger. Full recovery will require restoring the trust and confidence of the
business community in the infrastructures, in financial institutions, and in the future. The
Great Depression outlasted its proximate causes by many years, despite strenuous efforts
by the Federal Government to implement financial reforms and jump-start the economy,
in part because businesses were unwilling to risk their capital in a system that had lost
their confidence.
The Department of the Treasury and the SEC share the view that failure of electronic
systems supporting the critical infrastructure for even one business day threatens the
financial system with wide-scale disruption and risk to one or more critical markets.
Indeed, the Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the
U.S. Financial System, by the Department of the Treasury and the SEC advocates “the
overall goal of achieving recovery and resumption within two hours after an event.” It
states:
In light of the large volume and value of transactions/payments
that are cleared and settled on a daily basis, failure to complete
the clearing and settlement of pending transactions
within the business day could create systemic liquidity dislocations,
as well as exacerbate credit and market risk for critical
markets. Therefore, core clearing and settlement organizations
should develop the capacity to recover and resume clearing
and settlement activities within the business day on which the
disruption occurs with the overall goal of achieving recovery
and resumption within two hours after an event.41
Partial or small-scale disruption of the financial infrastructure would probably be
enough to bring about a major economic crisis. Nonfunctioning ATM machines, for
example, and other impediments to obtaining cash might well undermine consumer confidence
in the banking system and cause a panic. NSTAC observes that the ultimate purpose
behind all the financial industry’s security efforts is to retain consumer confidence:
“The ability of an institution to maintain the trust, and hence, the business, of its customers
is viewed as an even greater value than the dollars and cents involved.”42 A related
NAS study concludes that an attack that destroys only electronic records would be
“catastrophic and irreversible.”43 Although it is highly unlikely that stored financial data
on magnetic media would be damaged by EMP, the electronic systems for retrieving data
are potentially vulnerable to EMP and are dependent on a vulnerable power grid. Data
and essential records are useless if inaccessible. According to the NAS, “Irrecoverable

loss of critical operating data and essential records on a large scale would likely result in
catastrophic and irreversible damage to U.S. society.”44
Recommendations
Securing the financial services industry from the EMP threat and from other threats is
vital to the national security of the United States. The Federal Government must ensure
that this system can survive sufficiently to preclude serious, long-term consequences.
The Department of Homeland Security, the FRB, and the Department of the Treasury,
in cooperation with other relevant agencies, must develop contingency plans to survive
and recover key financial systems promptly from an EMP attack.
Key financial services include the means and resources that provide the general population
with cash, credit, and other liquidity required to buy essential goods and services. It
is essential to protect the Nation’s financial networks, banking records, and data retrieval
systems that support cash, check, credit, debit, and other transactions through judicious
balance of hardening, redundancy, and contingency plans.
The Federal Government must work with the private sector to ensure the protection and
effective recovery of essential financial records and services infrastructure systems from
all deliberate adverse events, including EMP attack. Implementation of the recommendations
made by the Department of the Treasury, the FRB, and the SEC in their Interagency
Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System to
meet sabotage and cyberthreats that could engender requirements for protection and
recovery should be expanded to include expeditious recovery from EMP attack as
follows:
􀂋 “Every organization in the financial services industry should identify all clearing and
settlement activities in each critical financial market in which it is a core clearing and
settlement organization or plays a significant role” that could be threatened by EMP
attack.
􀂋 Industry should “determine appropriate recovery and resumption objectives for clearing
and settlement activities in support of critical markets” following an EMP attack.
􀂋 Industry should be prepared to cope with an EMP attack by maintaining “sufficient
geographically dispersed resources to meet recovery and resumption objectives….
Back-up sites should not rely on the same infrastructure components (e.g.,
transportation, telecommunications, water supply, electric power) used by the primary
site. Moreover, the operation of such sites should not be impaired by a wide-scale
evacuation at or inaccessibility of staff that service the primary site.”
􀂋 Industry should “routinely use or test recovery and resumption arrangements…. It is
critical for firms to test back-up facilities of markets, core clearing and settlement
organizations, and third-party service providers to ensure connectivity, capacity, and
the integrity of data transmission” against an EMP attack.45

Chapter 5. Petroleum and Natural Gas
Introduction
The United States economy is dependent on the availability of energy. While much of
that energy originates in natural resources of coal, hydroelectric, and nuclear materials
and is distributed to users through the electric power grid, more than 60 percent of all
U.S. domestic energy1 usage derives from petroleum (about 40 percent) and natural gas
(more than 20 percent) and is distributed to users through an extensive national pipeline
system. Refined petroleum products and natural gas power our cars, heat our homes,
energize our factories, and comprise critical elements of industrial materials ranging from
fertilizers to plastics, all enabling the normal functioning of our energy intensive civil
society. In 2006, according to the Annual Energy Review, the United States imported an
average of 10 million barrels of crude oil and 11.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas every
day. Domestically the United States produced about 5 million barrels of crude and 50.6
billion cubic feet of dry gas daily. All of these energy resources were delivered from their
points of production or ports of entry to users or further distribution points through the
national pipeline system.
While the closely related petroleum and natural gas infrastructures comprise a variety
of production, processing, storage, and delivery elements, as described in the next section,
the focus of this chapter will be on the delivery system. In particular, we shall focus
on the potential electromagnetic pulse (EMP) vulnerability of the more than 180,000
miles of interstate natural gas pipelines and the more than 55,000 miles of large — 8-inch
to 24-inch diameter — oil pipelines.2 We shall point to the potential vulnerabilities of the
electronic control systems — supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA)
— that were discussed in general terms in Chapter 1, but whose criticality and centrality
for the operation of the petroleum and natural gas infrastructure distribution systems are
particularly prominent. Control system components with low voltage and current
requirements, such as integrated circuits, digital computers, and digital circuitry, are
ubiquitous in the U.S. commercial petroleum and natural gas infrastructures, and EMPcaused
failures can induce dangerous system malfunctions resulting in fires or
explosions.
Infrastructure Description
Petroleum
The petroleum infrastructure can be divided into two parts: the upstream sector, which
includes exploration and production of crude oil, and the downstream sector, which comprises
the refining, transmission, and distribution of the finished petroleum product.
Physical components of the upstream sector include land oil wells and waterborne oil
rigs for exploration, drilling, and extraction of crude oil. In 2006, there were 274 rotary
rigs operating on- and off-shore in the United States and 501,000 crude oil producing
wells (figure 5-1). In addition, many elements of the production of crude oil are located
abroad, because the majority of U.S. oil is imported.
In contrast to the production stages of petroleum, the United States is the largest producer
of refined petroleum products in the world. In 2006, 149 refineries were producing

approximately 23 percent of the world’s refinery output. These refineries range in production
capabilities from 5,000 barrels to approximately 500,000 barrels per day. Nearly
one-half of America’s refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, mostly in Texas
and Louisiana. Other major refineries are found throughout the Midwest and in California,
Washington, and along the East Coast of the United States.
The most pervasive physical element of the oil infrastructure is the extensive transmission
network that moves crude oil from the field to the refineries for processing and
brings the finished products to the consumer. Pipelines are the safest and most economical
way to accomplish this and account for nearly 50 percent of all crude oil received in
domestic refineries in 2006. Tankers transport an additional 46 percent of the crude oil
received by refineries, with the remaining crude oil delivered to refineries by barge, rail
tank car, and truck. There are approximately 55,000 miles of crude oil trunk lines (8-inch
to 24-inch diameter) and an additional 30,000 to 40,000 miles of smaller gathering lines
(2-inch to 6-inch diameter) across the United States. The trunk lines connect regional
markets, while the smaller gathering lines transport crude oil from the well — on- or offshore
— to larger trunk lines and are located mainly in Texas and Louisiana. Movement
of the refined products, such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, to the marketplace is done
largely by tankers. In addition, there are approximately 95,000 refined product pipelines
nationwide, varying in diameter from 8 to 12 inches to 42 inches, that bring products to
their final destinations.
Storage facilities are an integral part of the movement of oil by rail, highway, pipeline,
barge, and tanker and can be aboveground, underground, or offshore. In the United

States, the most common storage tank is aboveground and made of steel plates. Most
underground storage tanks are made out of steel as well. These storage facilities are
located at each node in the production and distribution of petroleum and include tanks at
the production field, marine terminals, refineries, pipeline pumping stations, retail facilities,
car gasoline tanks, and home heating tanks.
In 2006, the United States imported about 60 percent of its petroleum consumption
from abroad. Four thousand U.S. off-shore platforms, 2,000 petroleum terminals, and
4,000 oil tankers belonging to the world’s energy trading nations and unloading petroleum
at 185 ports in the United States, must also be counted as part of the petroleum
infrastructure.
Natural Gas
The natural gas infrastructure comprises production wells, processing stations, storage
facilities, and the national pipeline system (see figure 5-2).
Figure 5-2. Natural Gas Infrastructure
In 2006, there were 448,461 gas- and condensate-producing wells4 distributed among
63,3535 oil and gas fields in the United States. There were more than 500 natural gas
processing plants6 and more than 1,400 compressor stations that maintain pressures in the
pipeline and assure the forward motion of the transmitted gas supply. Storage facilities
included 394 active underground storage fields, consisting of depleted oil and gas fields,
aquifers, and salt caverns, five liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities, and 100
LNG peaking facilities. The pipeline system consists of more than 300,000 miles of interstate
and intrastate transmission lines and an additional 1.8 million miles of smaller distribution
lines that move gas closer to cities and to individual homes and business.

Most of the natural gas consumed in the United States is produced domestically. Historically
domestic production has accounted for around 85 percent of U.S. consumption
with imports from Canada making up the remaining 15 percent. In recent years, domestic
production has fallen to about 75 percent of consumption with the remainder imported
from Canada. In 2005, five states — Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Louisiana, and New
Mexico — accounted for 77 percent of domestic natural gas production.
Direct Effects of EMP on Petroleum and Natural Gas Infrastructure
The infrastructure described in the previous section is dependent on the continuous
operation of a wide variety of electrical components: pumps to extract fuel from wells
and manage its movement through pipelines, electrically driven systems to process materials
in refineries, transportation systems to deliver fuels to users from storage sites,
point-of-sale electronics to process transactions to retail customers, and so on — all of
which represent potential points of vulnerability to an EMP pulse. We shall focus here on
the vulnerability due to only one of these components — SCADA — because they represent
a ubiquitous presence across all the different infrastructure elements and play a
series of critical roles whose loss would severely compromise, or in some instances
eliminate altogether, the ability of the infrastructure to function.
SCADA systems themselves, and their tested vulnerability to electromagnetic pulses,
were described in some detail in Chapter 1, the introductory chapter to this volume, and
we shall not repeat that here. Instead we describe the particular role of SCADAs within
the petroleum and natural gas infrastructure, and then consider the consequences of an
event which degrades or destroys the control and monitoring functions performed by the
SCADAs.
Petroleum Infrastructure and SCADA
SCADAs play a critical role at every stage of the oil industry’s life cycle: production,
refining, transportation, and distribution. Automation within the oil industry begins at the
resource exploration stage and ends with final delivery to the customer. At each step,
process control and SCADA are used not only to ensure that operations are efficient, but
also that strict safety measures are maintained to prevent injuries and fatalities, fires and
explosions, and ecological disasters.
SCADA systems, for example, are deployed in production fields, pipeline gathering
systems, and along pipelines to monitor and adjust various operating parameters. These
monitoring functions assist oil companies in preventing leaks and other hazardous conditions,
as well as minimizing the impact of those that do occur.
These systems, which involve two-way traffic requiring paired channels, allow a master
station to monitor and control the status of a multitude of measurements and tolerance
limits at wellheads, pump stations, and valves, thus eliminating the need for constant
manual surveillance. Figure 5-3 presents a typical SCADA system for offshore oil production
and onshore oil distribution, showing the use of remote terminal units (RTUs)
and distributed control systems (DCS) at remote locations and their connection with the
master terminal units (MTUs) through various communication media.
Pumping facilities that produce thousands of horsepower of energy and metering facilities
that measure thousands of barrels per hour are routinely operated remotely via these
SCADA systems. They can be properly operated only by using extremely reliable communications
systems. The control aspect may include controls to a well pump to increase

or decrease output or to shut down altogether. Pipeline controls may include changing
routing, increasing or reducing the flow of the liquids or gases, and other functions.
However, some pipeline facilities still require manual operation.
Process control is concerned with maintaining process variables, temperatures, pressures,
flows, compositions, and the like at some desired operating value. Process control
systems within refineries, along pipelines, and in producing fields were previously closed
and proprietary. These control processes are now moving toward open architecture and
commercially available software. The oil infrastructure now relies on e-commerce, commodity
trading, business-to-business systems, electronic bulletin boards, computer networks,
and other critical business systems to operate and connect the infrastructure.
These assessment and control tools depend to a large degree on telecommunications and
associated information technologies. Telecommunication in this context refers to a system
of information linkages and data exchanges that include SCADA, the associated
SCADA communication links, control systems, and integrated management information
systems.
Natural Gas Infrastructure and SCADA
SCADA is essential to modern natural gas operations. These systems provide the nearreal-
time data flows needed to operate efficiently in a deregulated environment. In addition,
SCADA provides reporting of all transactions, establishing financial audit trails.
The key to effectively managing natural gas deliveries to customers is knowing what is
happening along an interstate or intrastate pipeline system at all times. This is accomplished
with Gas Control — a centralized command post that continuously receives
information from facilities along the pipeline and disseminates information and operational
orders to equipment and personnel in the field (see figure 5-4).
Through the use of SCADA equipment, Gas Control monitors volumes, pressures, and
temperatures, as well as the operating status of pipeline facilities. Using microwave, telephone,
or communication satellites, SCADA provides the Gas Control operator with
information on the volume of natural gas flowing into the system and the volume of gas
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 5. Petroleum and Natural Gas
100
Figure 5-4. SCADA Integrates Control of Remote Natural Gas Facilities
delivered to customers and gives the ability to quickly identify and react to equipment
malfunctions or incidents. SCADA also gives Gas Control the capability to remotely start
or stop compressors or open or close valves, thereby varying flow volumes to meet
changes in customer demand for natural gas. Before the advent of SCADAs, all such
functions, including tedious flow computations, were performed manually.
Automation of natural gas operations employs electronic components and technology to
a high degree. Many of these components use simple mechanical or electrical properties
to perform their defined roles, but an increasing number of them are computer-based. The
major components and subsystems are RTUs, programmable logic controllers (PLC),
MTUs, and communication systems, both wired and wireless. The total SCADA structure
also includes control centers, information technology, personal computers (PC), and other
peripheral technologies. RTUs and PLCs are usually located at the remote operational
sites and connected to the MTUs and communication infrastructure through the communications
network.
Effects of an EMP Event on the U.S. Petroleum and Natural Gas
Infrastructures
There are few empirical data to support definitive statements regarding the precise
effects of an EMP event, should one occur. We can only extrapolate from what is known
about the effects of various levels of EMP testing and what is indicated by other types of
ongoing tests. It is evident that electronic devices, particularly those incorporating solidstate
circuitry are, to varying degrees, susceptible to the effects of an EMP event.
The principal electronic components of a SCADA system, those devices most vulnerable
to an EMP attack, are found in all the major subsystems of the SCADA installation.
The MTU is a modern computer, with various solid-state circuits embedded on the
microchips contained inside. An EMP event may affect these, either as a temporary disruption,
which, if not automatically rebooted, might require manual intervention, or with
permanent damage. If MTUs are not physically damaged, it may not be obvious whether
their functional state has altered. As discussed earlier, loss of the MTU would blind the
Control Center personnel to system data and performance. The physical system (e.g.,
pipelines, refineries) would continue to operate within the limits of the preprogrammed
RTU controls, assuming that these components also have not been adversely affected by
the EMP event.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 5. Petroleum and Natural Gas
101
The RTUs and PLCs used in today’s SCADA systems rely on solid-state circuits to
maintain their programming and to carry out the directives issued through those programs.
This design makes the RTU and PLC inherently vulnerable to an EMP event.
Although small, remote installations potentially have less exposure, it can be assumed
that some or all of the RTUs and PLCs would be affected by an EMP event. As in the
case of the MTU, affected embedded, integrated chips are suspect, even if the damage is
not total and perhaps not immediately evident.
Gas
Functional loss of the RTU and PLC results in loss of supervisory control at that location.
The equipment is unable to direct changes in pressure to match changes in demand
requirements for the natural gas sector. The gas delivery system should continue to operate,
and natural gas should continue to flow, but ultimately the system may reach extreme
conditions. Due to the presence of backup emergency pressure regulation, it is unlikely
that such a failure would lead to an unsafe condition, one that would cause a rupture or
explosion. The most likely result, given no manual intervention, would be significant loss
of pressure after some period of time, leading to massive service disruption.
Currently, if any component of the control system (e.g., RTU, PLC, MTU) for the natural
gas infrastructure fails, the system still has the mechanical ability to operate as it did
in the days before SCADA. An EMP-induced false signal might affect operation if the
signal unexpectedly closed a valve instead of keeping it open. The SCADA system would
then have no ability to adjust to changing conditions; however, except in extreme cases
such as peak winter demand conditions, it should be able to maintain deliveries until field
personnel arrive and institute manual control. Discussions with natural gas system
operators provide a consensus that it would be highly unlikely that the natural gas pipeline
system would be shut down immediately if it is recognized that there is problem with
the field data.
Oil
If the SCADA system for an oil pipeline is inoperative due to the effects of an EMP
event, it is the opinion of a number of former pipeline personnel that operations would
have to be shut down. A petroleum pipeline failure can be catastrophic. Leaking oil could
contaminate water supplies and cause disastrous fires. Based on their experience, it has
been stated that companies that operate any type of complex pipeline system today do not
have enough personnel to manually operate the system using on-site operators with telephone
communications (which may not be available after an EMP event) to a central
control center, due in part to the multiple sites that need to be monitored and controlled
during an emergency. Over the past decade, there has been a trend to increase remote
control capability while reducing personnel in the oil and natural gas pipeline industry.
U.S. refineries are critically dependent on the computers and integrated circuitry associated
with process control, which are vulnerable to EMP effects. Discussions with plant
managers and process control engineers at a number of refineries gave a nearly unanimous
response that loss of process control would lead to refinery shutdown. A number of
refineries stated they maintain an emergency override fail-safe system that institutes a
controlled shutdown of the refinery if various SCADA parameters are out of range. However,
the very short notice of a process control outage and the emergency shutdown procedure
a refinery must undergo significantly increase the potential for equipment damage
and lost production.

Indirect Effects of EMP: Accounting for Infrastructure Interdependencies
Infrastructure interdependency was discussed from a more general perspective in
Chapter 1. The petroleum and natural gas infrastructures provide illustrative examples of
such interdependencies as illustrated in figures 5-5 and 5-6.7
Figure 5-5. Examples of Oil Interdependencies
Figure 5-6. Examples of Natural Gas Interdependencies

interdependencies are shown.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 5. Petroleum and Natural Gas
103
The petroleum and natural gas infrastructures are critically dependent on the availability
of assured electric power from the national grid, as well as all the other critical
national infrastructures, including food and emergency services that sustain the personnel
manning these infrastructures. In turn, all these infrastructures rely on the availability of
fuels provided by the petroleum and natural gas sector.
Petroleum and natural gas systems are heavily dependent on commercial electricity
during the entire cycle of production, refining, processing, transport, and delivery to the
ultimate consumer. The availability of commercial power is the most important dependency
for the domestic oil sector. The natural gas infrastructure depends on electric power
to operate lube pumps for compressors, after-cooler fans, electronic control panels, voice
and data telecommunication, computers, SCADA communication and controls infrastructure,
gas control centers, and other critical components.
U.S. oil and natural gas companies operate a variety of telecommunications systems
that are used to provide the internal communications capabilities that are crucial to protecting
the safety of life, health, and property. These communications facilities are critical
for the day-to-day operations of these companies, as well as for their response to potentially
disastrous, life-threatening emergency situations. They are used for the direction of
personnel and equipment, the control and synchronization of multiple geophysical acoustical
signal sources for oil and gas exploration, and the telemetering of geophysical data.
Mobile radio plays a critical role in providing communications for the management of
individual wells; pipeline gathering systems; and in the transfer, loading, and delivery of
petroleum products to end user consumers. In the event of emergency conditions, communication
systems are essential to ensure the safety of personnel, the adjacent population,
and the surrounding environment.
Petroleum and natural gas infrastructures are generally well equipped with gas-driven
compressors and gas- or diesel-fired pumping facilities and backup generators that would
enable the continued flow of natural gas, crude oil, and refined product deliveries for a
limited time or that would implement a controlled shutdown following an interruption of
electric power supply. There is also a possibility these backup generators may not function
after an EMP event if they contain sensitive electronic components such as electronic
control units. As one example of interdependency between the fuel and transportation
sectors, we note that emergency generators that may keep critical electrical components
of the petroleum and natural gas infrastructures running may become inoperative for lack
of delivered fuel by a transportation sector short of fuels to run its trucks.
An electric power, water, or transportation disruption of short duration would not necessarily
affect the operation of oil and natural gas infrastructure due to backup power and
water resources. It is anticipated that crude oil and refined product deliveries could continue
to flow for a few days, should these infrastructures be adversely affected. In the
short term, natural gas deliveries are facilitated by the combined flexibility afforded by
underground storage facilities and by line pack (the volume of gas maintained in the line
at pressures above required delivery pressures). But outages of a few days or more can be
expected to severely affect all infrastructure operations.
Recommendations
The Federal Government should take the lead in identifying this threat to the oil and
gas industry sectors and specify ways to mitigate its potential consequences.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 5. Petroleum and Natural Gas
104
􀂋 The Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) should, with government
funding, expand its mission to address EMP issues relative to the petroleum and natural
gas industries. This would include facilitating a government/industry partnership in
addressing policy, investment prioritization, and science and technology issues.
􀂋 The Federal Government should review the feasibility of establishing a national inventory
of component parts for those items that would be either in great demand or have
long lead times, to be made available in a catastrophic event such as an EMP incident.
􀂋 Protect critical components.
— The oil and natural gas industries should develop resource lists of existing SCADA
and process control systems, with prearranged contracts and potential suppliers in
the event of an EMP incident.
— A study should be performed that prioritizes critical facilities of the oil and gas sector
for future hardening against EMP effects.
— Industry should strongly urge its members that have not already done so to install
backup control centers to provide operational continuity. Industry should also
explore the site location decisions for backup control centers so that adequate geographic
separation between the main site and the backup facility is provided to protect
against simultaneous damage in the event of a single EMP event.
􀂋 Develop training and exercises.
— Individual companies should consider engaging in regional response and recovery
planning and exercises to deal with disruptions to physical and cyber infrastructures
resulting from an EMP event.
— Emergency response manuals should be revised to include periodically recurring
EMP event training for current and future work force.
— Detailed simulation of the petroleum and natural gas infrastructure on a regional or
local basis should be performed to provide a more accurate assessment of the
potential impact of EMP-induced damage to these infrastructures.
􀂋 Conduct research.
— Research and development efforts should stress hardening of SCADA and other
digital control systems equipment, both existing and new components, to mitigate
the impact of a future EMP event. New standards for oil and gas control systems
should be established with the industry to avoid potential damage from EMP
effects. These efforts could best be accomplished by the participation of the various
industry members, organizations (e.g., American Gas Association [AGA], Interstate
Natural Gas Association of America [INGAA], Gas Technology Institute [GTI],
American Petroleum Institute [API]), and government agencies.
— A cost-benefit analysis should be conducted for protecting the commercial petroleum
and gas infrastructure against the effects of an EMP. If the costs are estimated
to be substantial, the Federal Government should defray a portion of these costs.

Introduction
Transportation has played an essential role in our development from scattered settlements
to a modern nation. Maritime (i.e., oceanic) shipping sustained the first settlements
some five centuries ago and remains the most important avenue for intercontinental commerce
today. The 18th century saw the rise of canals in the eastern states, and interest in
them lasted through the first decades of the 19th century. Later the railroad supplanted
canals in the east and opened the western territories for large-scale economic development
and settlement. The 20th century witnessed the advent of the airplane and the
automobile, both of which have radically transformed our economy and society. Water,
rail, road, and air transportation now bind us together as a nation—economically,
socially, and politically.
The criticality of transportation, the impact of potential disruptions, and the need to
address vulnerabilities has received national attention. As recognized by the President’s
National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) Information
Infrastructure Group Report:1
􀂋 The transportation industry is increasingly reliant on information technology (IT) and
public information-transporting networks.
􀂋 Although a nationwide disruption of the transportation infrastructure may be unlikely,
even a local or regional disruption could have a significant impact. Because of the
diversity and redundancy of the United States (U.S.) transportation system, the infrastructure
is not at risk of nationwide disruption resulting from information system failure.
Nonetheless, a disruption of the transportation information infrastructure on a
regional or local scale has potential for widespread economic and national security
effects.
􀂋 Marketplace pressures and increasing use of IT make large-scale, multimodal disruptions
more likely in the future. As the infrastructure becomes more interconnected and
interdependent, the transportation industry will increasingly rely on IT to perform its
most basic business functions. As this occurs, it becomes more likely that information
system failures could result in large-scale disruptions of multiple modes of the transportation
infrastructure.
􀂋 There is a need for a broad-based infrastructure assurance awareness program to assist
all modes of transportation.
􀂋 The transportation industry could leverage ongoing research and development initiatives
to improve the security of the transportation information infrastructure.
􀂋 There is a need for closer coordination between the transportation industry and other
critical infrastructures.
The transportation sector of the economy is often addressed as a single infrastructure,
but in reality its various modes provide for several separate, but related, infrastructures.
Rail includes the long-haul railroad and commuter rail infrastructures, air includes the
commercial and general aviation infrastructures, road includes the automobile and trucking
infrastructures, and water includes both the maritime shipping and inland waterway

infrastructures.2 A combination of considerations—importance to the economy, potential
for loss of life as a result of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, and criticality to
civilian enterprises—has led us to focus on the long-haul railroad, trucking and
automobile, maritime shipping, and commercial aviation infrastructures.
As far as transportation has developed, it is still far from static. The forces driving the
continuing evolution of the transportation infrastructures can be understood in terms of
the pursuit of competitive advantage, which derives from both lower cost and superior
performance. Of particular importance, pressures for cost reduction have led to widespread
adoption of just-in-time delivery practices. These practices not only reduce costs
associated with maintaining large inventories, but also create strong dependencies on
automated tracking of inventories and automatic sorting and loading to achieve efficient
and reliable delivery of supplies and equipment. Just-in-time delivery is made possible by
the application of technological advances in remote tracking, computer controls, data
processing, inventory management, telecommunications, and uninterrupted movement.
These technologies are all electronics-based and, hence, potentially vulnerable to EMP.
The imperative to achieve superior performance also has led to greater use of electronics,
which has introduced a potential vulnerability to EMP. The automobile provides a
familiar example of this phenomenon. Modern automobiles use electronics to increase
engine performance, increase fuel efficiency, reduce emissions, increase diagnostic capability,
and increase passenger safety and comfort.
To gauge the degree of vulnerability of
the long-haul railway, trucking and automobile,
maritime shipping, and commercial
aviation infrastructures to EMP, the
Commission has assessed selected components
of these infrastructures that are vital
to their operations. Our assessment is based on both data collected from testing conducted
under the auspices of the Commission and other available test data that have direct applicability
to transportation infrastructure assessment. For critical components of these
infrastructures that we were unable to test—notably airplanes, air traffic control centers,
locomotives, railroad control centers and signals, and ports—our assessment relies on
surveys of equipment and communications links.
Long-Haul Railroad
Railroads excel at carrying voluminous or heavy freight over long distances. Class I
railroad freight3 in 2003 totaled some 1.8 billion tons originated.4 The major categories of
2 Pipelines are sometimes associated with the transportation infrastructure but can be considered more usefully as part
of the petroleum and natural gas infrastructures.
3 The division of railroads into classes based on total operating revenue was a taxonomy defined by the Interstate
Commerce Commission in the 1930s. The original threshold for a Class I railroad was $1 million. In 2006, Class I
railroads were those with operating revenues exceeding $319.3 million. In North America, there are currently seven
U.S. railroads that are defined as Class I, with an additional two Canadian railroads that would be considered Class I
if U.S. definitions were applied. The old Class II and Class III designators are rarely used today. Instead, the
Association of American Railroads speaks of regional railroads operating greater than 350 route-miles or generating
more than $40 million revenue, local line haul carriers with less than 350 route-miles and generating less than $40
million revenue, and switching and terminal services carriers with highly localized functions,
http://www.railswest.com/railtoday.html.
4 “Tons originated” is a common term of art and index in the railroad industry used to track freight traffic volume. It is
equal to the tons of traffic shipped by rail. Tons originated rail statistics are available from 1899.

freight carried by railroads, illustrated in figure 6-1, include coal, chemicals, farm products,
minerals, food products, and a variety of the other goods essential to the operation
of our economy.5
Coal dominates all other categories of freight, accounting for 44 percent of Class I railroad
tonnage in 2003. More than 90 percent of this coal, some 700 million tons, is delivered
annually to coal-fired power plants. Power plants that depend on railroad-delivered
coal account for more than one-third of our electricity production. Today, these plants
typically have only several days’ to a month’s supply of coal on site. While this reserve
provides a useful buffer, under conditions of a prolonged failure of railroads to deliver
coal, these plants would simply have to shut down.6 Electricity production would be
affected most in the Midwest, Southeast, and Southwest, regions more heavily dependent
on coal-fired power plants.7
Railroads have achieved significant gains in efficiency and safety by modernizing and
automating their operations. Today, freight railways are controlled and operated from a
limited number of centralized control centers. For example, the western U.S. Union
Pacific tracks are managed from Omaha, NE, and the Burlington Northern/Santa Fe
tracks are managed from Dallas, TX. These centers, as well as operations throughout the
rail system, use extensive communication networks for sensing, monitoring, and control.
If a railroad control center becomes inoperable or loses communications with the rail
network for any reason, all rail traffic in the affected domain will stop until communications
are restored or backup procedures are implemented.

Railroad Control Centers
We conducted an EMP vulnerability survey of CSX Transportation (CSXT), the railroad
subsidiary of the CSX Corporation. CSXT operates the largest rail network in the
eastern United States. Like the other major railroad companies, CSXT has centralized its
critical control facilities in a single geographical area. The CSXT Jacksonville, FL, railroad
control center includes three key nodes, each housed in a separate building—a customer
service center, an advanced IT center, and a train dispatch center (figure 6-2).
These buildings have no specific electromagnetic protection. About 1,200 trains are handled
by the CSXT control center in a typical day.
Railroad control center operations
rely on modern IT equipment—
mainframe and personal
computers, servers, routers, local
area networks (LAN), tape
storage units—some of which
are similar to commercial offthe-
shelf (COTS) equipment that
has been EMP-tested. Based on
this similarity, we expect
anomalous responses of the IT
equipment to begin at EMP field
levels of approximately 4 to 8
kV/m. We expect damage to
begin at fields of approximately
8 to 16 kV/m.
The CSXT railroad control center buildings rely on diesel power generators for standby
power and central uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems to provide continuous
power to critical loads. Some buildings require chilled water for continuing computer
operations. The buildings are interconnected by a fiber-optic ring and telephone lines.
None of this equipment has specific EMP protection, and there are no data on the EMP
vulnerability of this equipment.
The three railroad control center nodes are almost totally dependent on telephone lines
(copper and fiber) for communications and data transfer. If all landlines fail, they still can
communicate over a small number of satellite telephones, but data transfers would be
severely limited.
Concerns about terrorist attacks and
hurricanes have motivated CSXT to make
provisions to operate for an extended
period without support from the infrastructure.
These provisions include diesel
generators in case the two independent
commercial power feeds should fail, fuel
and food stored for 25 to 30 days of
operation, beds for 50 people, and on-site wells to provide water.
In addition, all three of the key nodes have remote backup sites, either in Maryland or
in the northern Midwest. This geographical dispersion provides some protection from a
limited EMP attack. However, these backup sites rely on personnel in the Jacksonville
Figure 6-2. CSXT Train Dispatch Center

Based on our assessment and test
results, a weak link in the railroad infrastructure
is the railroad signal controls,
which can malfunction and slow railroad
operations following exposure to EMP
fields as low as a few kV/m.

109
area for operations at the remote sites, which makes them dependent on the infrastructure
for transporting their personnel. It is possible that their personnel could be transported
over the CSXT rail system if air and road transportation was interrupted by an EMP
attack. They also are dependent on commercial telephone service to transfer the Jacksonville
telephone numbers to the alternate sites and to establish the alternate data links.
In the case of EMP-caused outages of the three key facilities and the failure of the
backup sites, railroad operations would be severely degraded. Customers could not place
shipping orders, data processing would cease, and, most important, train orders could not
be generated. Train orders define the makeup of trains, their routes, and their priorities on
the track. Trains cannot operate without orders and would revert to fail-safe procedures.
The first priority would be to stop the trains. If it were apparent that the outages would
last for more than a few hours, efforts would be made to move the trains to the yards.
This process could take up to 24 hours.
Once the trains and their crews are secured, plans would be made to resume operations
under manual procedures. Implementation of manual procedures could take several days
or longer, during which time it would be difficult to operate at more than approximately
10 to 20 percent of normal capacity. Train orders can be issued manually using satellite
telephones. The biggest challenge is maintaining communications with trains that are
underway. Train yards can communicate with trains by radio. If the trains are within
about 20 miles of the yard, the entire communication path is wireless. However, longerrange
communications use landlines to repeater stations along the train routes. The
repeater station batteries provide only about 24 hours of standby power.
Shipment of critical supplies likely could resume under manual control operations.
Transporting food from farms to storage warehouses and from storage warehouses to cities
would be a high priority. Trains also deliver chemicals that cities use to purify drinking
water and treat waste water. As discussed above, power plants generally have some
reserve of coal on hand, but eventually it would become crucial to resume coal shipments
to power plants.
Railroad Signal Controls
Railroads use two main types of controls: block controls and local controls. Figure 6-3
shows a typical block signal control equipment enclosure and antenna. Block controls are
used to assure that the next section (block) of track is clear before a train enters it. The
main communications from the railroad control centers to the block controls uses a mix
of radios and telephones. Block controls have battery backups that can sustain operations
for up to 24 hours.
Local control systems manage grade crossings and signal both the train and the road
traffic at a crossing. These control systems are designed to operate autonomously. Some
modern local control systems have a minimal communications capability that consists of
a telephone modem for fault reporting and possible downloading of programs and
parameters for the controllers. Local control systems have battery back-up power, which
would provide for normal operations from 8 to 48 hours, depending on the volume of
train traffic.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure
110
Figure 6-4 shows a typical local grade
crossing control shelter and sensor connection.
Local control systems have sensors bolted or
welded directly to the rails. The resistance of
the circuit, closed by the train wheels and axle,
is measured and used to predict the train’s
arrival at the crossing. Modern systems are in
shielded steel enclosures that include extensive
surge protection.
Similar electronics technologies are used in
both road and rail signal controllers. Based on
this similarity and previous test experience with
these types of electronics, we expect malfunction
of both block and local railroad signal
controllers, with latching upset beginning at
EMP field strengths of approximately 1 kV/m
and permanent damage occurring in the 10 to
15 kV/m range.
The major effect of railroad signal control
failures will be delayed traffic. For centrally controlled areas of track, if block signals
were inoperative, manual block authority would be implemented. Where possible, signal
teams would be sent out to manually control failed switches. Crews also would set up
portable diesel units to power railroad crossings that had lost power. Railroad crossing
generators are on hand for emergencies, such as hurricanes. Repair and recovery times
will be on the order of days to weeks. If commercial power is unavailable for periods
longer than approximately 24 hours, degraded railroad operations will persist under manual
control until batteries or commercial power is restored.

Locomotives
We conducted an assessment of diesel-electric locomotives at the GE Transportation
Systems plant (one of two manufacturers of diesel-electric locomotives) in Erie, PA. Our
assessment is based on a review of locomotive construction practices, operational procedures,
and limited test data. While we do not have direct test data on EMP effects on diesel-
electric locomotives, some data are available from a test of a locomotive of different

design that may provide some insight into the robustness of typical locomotive control
electronics and subsystems.8
Two classes of locomotives were considered—those of the pre-microprocessor era and
the more modern locomotives that make extensive use of electronic controls. Approximately
20 percent of the locomotive population is of the older generation; these are rapidly
being replaced by the newer models. Electronics are not used to control critical
functions in the older locomotives. We consider this generation of locomotives to be
immune to EMP effects. While the locomotives themselves are considered immune, loss
of communications with central dispatch or within the train requires that the engineer
stop the train.
A block diagram showing the critical functions in the more modern locomotives is
shown in figure 6-5. The major functions are traction (movement) and communications,
both of which make extensive use of electronic components and, thus, are potentially
vulnerable to EMP. As with older locomotives, the communications include communications
to central dispatch and to other parts of the train. If these communications are lost
for any reason, the train is required to stop.

The traction function is totally computer controlled, with the important exception of the
engineer’s emergency braking system. Three computers are used to control all major subsystems.
Malfunction or loss of any of the computers will bring the train to a halt.
Restoring operation could require the replacement of computers. Because few spare computers
are provisioned, operations could be degraded until new computers are manufactured
and installed—a process that could take months.
It is important to note that computer failure or total loss of power in the locomotives
could cause loss of electrical control for the brakes. In this case, there is a totally independent,
nonelectrical system that the engineer can activate to apply the brakes in both
the engine and the cars, thereby halting the train. Therefore, even in the worst case, the
engineer can stop the train and prevent train crashes.
Because we did not directly test EMP effects on diesel-electric locomotives, the EMP
vulnerability levels can be estimated based only on existing data for computer network
response, locomotive construction methods, and the limited data available from the previously
referenced test on an electro-mechanical locomotive belonging to the Swiss Fed-

eral Railroad.9 Existing data for computer networks show that effects begin at field levels
in the 4 to 8 kV/m range, and damage starts in the 8 to 16 kV/m range. For locomotive
applications, the effects thresholds are expected to be somewhat higher because of the
large metal locomotive mass and use of shielded cables. Therefore, we expect that effects
will likely begin at incident field levels above the 20 to 40 kV/m range.
In summary, we consider the older generation of locomotives to be generally immune
to EMP effects. Newer, electronically controlled locomotives are potentially more vulnerable.
Based on construction practices, we expect that these vulnerabilities may manifest
at EMP levels greater than 20 to 40 kV/m. While vulnerabilities may cause the locomotives
to malfunction, fail-safe procedures ensure they can be stopped manually by
engineers. Hence, we do not anticipate catastrophic loss of life following EMP exposure.
Rather, we anticipate degraded operations, the severity of which depends on the incident
EMP field levels. Normal locomotive operations can be restored on time scales from days
to weeks or even longer. Restoration time scales could extend to months if computers, for
which there are few spares, must be manufactured and replaced.
The Automobile and Trucking Infrastructures
Over the past century, our society and economy have developed in tandem with the
automobile and trucking industries. As a consequence, we have become highly dependent
on these infrastructures for maintaining our way of life.
Our land-use patterns, in particular, have been enabled by the automobile and trucking
infrastructures. Distances between suburban housing developments, shopping centers,
schools, and employment centers enforce a high dependence on the automobile. Suburbanites
need their cars to get food from the grocery store, go to work, shop, obtain medical
care, and myriad other activities of daily life. Rural Americans are just as dependent
on automobiles, if not more so. Their needs are similar to those of suburbanites, and
travel distances are greater. To the extent that city dwellers rely on available mass transit,
they are less dependent on personal automobiles. But mass transit has been largely supplanted
by automobiles, except in a few of our largest cities.
As much as automobiles are important to maintaining our way of life, our very lives are
dependent on the trucking industry. The heavy concentration of our population in urban
and suburban areas has been enabled by the ability to continuously supply food from
farms and processing centers far removed. Today, cities typically have a food supply of
only several days available on grocery shelves for their customers. Replenishment of that
food supply depends on a continuous flow of trucks from food processing centers to food
distribution centers to warehouses and to grocery stores and restaurants. If urban food
supply flow is substantially interrupted for an extended period of time, hunger and mass
evacuation, even starvation and anarchy, could result.
Trucks also deliver other essentials. Fuel delivered to metropolitan areas through pipelines
is not accessible to the public until it is distributed by tanker trucks to gas stations.
Garbage removal, utility repair operations, fire equipment, and numerous other services

electro-mechanical locomotive in both power-on and power-off configurations. During the free-field illumination,
the test report states that “important analog/digital control electronics, deep inside the PC-boards, was repeatedly
burnt out.”

are delivered using specially outfitted trucks. Nearly 80 percent of all manufactured
goods at some point in the chain from manufacturer to consumer are transported by truck.
The consequences of an EMP attack on
the automobile and trucking infrastructures
would differ for the first day or so
and in the longer term. An EMP attack
will certainly immediately disable a portion
of the 130 million cars and 90 million
trucks in operation in the United
States. Vehicles disabled while operating
on the road can be expected to cause
accidents. With modern traffic patterns,
even a very small number of disabled
vehicles or accidents can cause debilitating traffic jams. Moreover, failure of electronically
based traffic control signals will exacerbate traffic congestion in metropolitan areas.
In the aftermath of an EMP attack that occurs during working hours, with a large number
of people taking to the road at the same time to try to get home, we can expect extreme
traffic congestion. Eventually, however, people will get home and roads will be cleared
as disabled cars are towed or pushed to the side of the road.
After the initial traffic congestion has subsided, the reconstitution of the automobile
and trucking infrastructures will depend primarily on two factors—the availability of fuel
and commercial power. Vehicles need fuel and service stations need electricity to power
pumps. Few service stations have backup generators. Thus, replenishing the fuel supply
and restoring commercial power will pace the return to normal operations. Similarly,
restoration of traffic control systems will depend on the availability of commercial power
and on the repair of damaged traffic control signals.
EMP Vulnerability of the Automobile and Trucking Infrastructures
We tested the EMP susceptibility of traffic light controllers, automobiles, and trucks.
Traffic Light Controllers
The road traffic control system is composed of sensors, control, and output systems.
Figure 6-6 shows a typical signalized intersection.

Our test results show that traffic light
controllers will begin to malfunction following
exposure to EMP fields as low as
a few kV/m, thereby causing traffic congestion.
Approximately 10 percent of the
vehicles on the road will stop, at least
temporarily, thereby possibly triggering
accidents, as well as congestion, at field
levels above 25 kV/m.

Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure

Control systems are implemented according to one of several specifications that have
evolved over the years. We performed tests of 170E type controllers, in use in approximately
80 percent of signalized intersections. We tested a single controller box populated
by multiple electronics cards. In the course of the testing, various cards were damaged and
subsequently replaced to continue the testing. Four different types of effects were observed
during intersection controller tests:
1. Forced Cycle: At field levels of 1 to 5 kV/m, the light was forced to cycle from green
to red without going through yellow. This is a transient effect that recovers automatically
after one cycle.
2. Disrupted Cycle: At field levels of 5 to 10 kV/m, the normally programmed cycle
times became corrupted and change to a cycle different from that originally programmed.
The controller had either been damaged or needed to be manually reset.
3. No Cycle: At 10 to 15 kV/m, the side street lights at an intersection never turned
green. The controller had been damaged.
4. Flash Mode: Also at 10 to 15 kV/m, the intersection went into a mode in which the
lights in all directions were flashing. This mode can cause large traffic jams because
traffic flow is severely reduced in this situation. The controller has either been damaged
or needs to be manually reset.
Based on these results, we anticipate that EMP will trigger moderate to severe traffic
congestion in metropolitan areas. The traffic congestion may be exacerbated by the panic
reactions possibly attendant to an EMP attack. None of the data predict or suggest lifethreatening
conditions; conflicting green lights did not occur during our tests. All the
observed effects would cause less traffic disruption than would a power outage, which
results in no working traffic lights.
The highway network’s dependency on electrical power was demonstrated during Hurricane
Isabel in 2003. Although some critical intersections were equipped with back-up
power supplies, they typically were operational only for 24 hours. In many localities,
during power outages, law enforcement officers were required to control the critical
intersections. As such, these officers were taken away from other activities that they
could be serving during emergencies.
Reestablishing normal traffic flow depends on the severity of the EMP-induced faults.
Manual resets for all traffic signals in a medium-sized city (population of 500,000) can be
accomplished in approximately a day, assuming available personnel.10 The timeline for
repairing damaged traffic controller boxes depends on the availability of spare parts. The
timeline for either manual resets or repairs under stressed conditions are unknown.
Major metropolitan areas are establishing traffic operations centers (TOC) as an integral
part of their traffic control infrastructure. A city’s TOC is responsible for downloading
the parameters controlling traffic signal timing and traffic signal coordination. However,
a TOC is not a critical node from a traffic control standpoint. If the center were to
become inoperable, the immediate effect would be on the city’s integrated traffic system;
the city would not be able to monitor its roadways, use its variable message signs along
priority roadways such as interstates, or produce content for the cable channels or Internet
updates that provide the public with information on traffic and highway conditions. The
primary long-term effect of a TOC failure would be a gradual drifting of the signal timing
synchronization that the center provides to the intersections to which it connects.

Automobiles
The potential EMP vulnerability of automobiles derives from the use of built-in electronics
that support multiple automotive functions. Electronic components were first
introduced into automobiles in the late 1960s. As time passed and electronics technologies
evolved, electronic applications in automobiles proliferated. Modern automobiles
have as many as 100 microprocessors that control virtually all functions. While electronic
applications have proliferated within automobiles, so too have application standards and
electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC) practices.
Thus, while it might be expected that increased EMP vulnerability would accompany the
proliferated electronics applications, this trend, at least in part, is mitigated by the
increased application of EMI/EMC practices.
We tested a sample of 37 cars in an EMP simulation laboratory, with automobile vintages
ranging from 1986 through 2002. Automobiles of these vintages include extensive
electronics and represent a significant fraction of automobiles on the road today. The
testing was conducted by exposing running and nonrunning automobiles to sequentially
increasing EMP field intensities. If anomalous response (either temporary or permanent)
was observed, the testing of that particular automobile was stopped. If no anomalous
response was observed, the testing was continued up to the field intensity limits of the
simulation capability (approximately 50 kV/m).
Automobiles were subjected to EMP environments under both engine turned off and
engine turned on conditions. No effects were subsequently observed in those automobiles
that were not turned on during EMP exposure. The most serious effect observed on running
automobiles was that the motors in three cars stopped at field strengths of approximately
30 kV/m or above. In an actual EMP exposure, these vehicles would glide to a
stop and require the driver to restart them. Electronics in the dashboard of one automobile
were damaged and required repair. Other effects were relatively minor. Twenty-five
automobiles exhibited malfunctions that could be considered only a nuisance (e.g.,
blinking dashboard lights) and did not require driver intervention to correct. Eight of the
37 cars tested did not exhibit any anomalous response.
Based on these test results, we expect few automobile effects at EMP field levels below
25 kV/m. Approximately 10 percent or more of the automobiles exposed to higher field
levels may experience serious EMP effects, including engine stall, that require driver
intervention to correct. We further expect that at least two out of three automobiles on the
road will manifest some nuisance response at these higher field levels. The serious malfunctions
could trigger car crashes on U.S. highways; the nuisance malfunctions could
exacerbate this condition. The ultimate result of automobile EMP exposure could be triggered
crashes that damage many more vehicles than are damaged by the EMP, the consequent
loss of life, and multiple injuries.
Trucks
As is the case for automobiles, the potential EMP vulnerability of trucks derives from
the trend toward increasing use of electronics. We assessed the EMP vulnerability of
trucks using an approach identical to that used for automobiles. Eighteen running and
nonrunning trucks were exposed to simulated EMP in a laboratory. The intensity of the
EMP fields was increased until either anomalous response was observed or simulator
limits were reached. The trucks ranged from gasoline-powered pickup trucks to large diesel-
powered tractors. Truck vintages ranged from 1991 to 2003.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure
116
Of the trucks that were not running during EMP exposure, none were subsequently
affected during our test. Thirteen of the 18 trucks exhibited a response while running.
Most seriously, three of the truck motors stopped. Two could be restarted immediately,
but one required towing to a garage for repair. The other 10 trucks that responded exhibited
relatively minor temporary responses that did not require driver intervention to correct.
Five of the 18 trucks tested did not exhibit any anomalous response up to field
strengths of approximately 50 kV/m.
Based on these test results, we expect few truck effects at EMP field levels below
approximately 12 kV/m. At higher field levels, 70 percent or more of the trucks on the
road will manifest some anomalous response following EMP exposure. Approximately
15 percent or more of the trucks will experience engine stall, sometimes with permanent
damage that the driver cannot correct.
Similar to the case for automobiles, the EMP impact on trucks could trigger vehicle
crashes on U.S. highways. As a result, many more vehicles could be damaged than those
damaged directly by EMP exposure.
Maritime Shipping
The key elements of the maritime infrastructure are ocean-going ships and their ports.
We did not perform an EMP assessment of ships.
There are more than 100 major public ports in the United States located along the
Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Great Lakes coasts, as well as in Alaska, Hawaii,
Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Deep-draft ports accommodate oceangoing
vessels, which move more than 95 percent of U.S. overseas trade by weight and 75
percent by value.11
Ports handle a variety of cargo categorized as bulk cargo, including liquid bulk (e.g.,
petroleum) and dry bulk cargo (e.g., grain); break bulk cargo in barrels, pallets, and other
packages; and general cargo in steel containers. Major commodities shipped through U.S.
ports include:12
􀂋 Crude petroleum and petroleum products—oil and gasoline
􀂋 Chemicals and related products—fertilizer
􀂋 Coal—bituminous, metallurgical, and steam
􀂋 Food and farm products—wheat and wheat flour, corn, soybeans, rice, cotton, and

Port Operations
Our assessment of maritime shipping infrastructure focuses on ports. EMP assessments
were conducted for the Port of Baltimore in Maryland and ports in the Hampton Roads,
VA, area. The Port of Baltimore assessment was performed at the Seagirt and Dundalk
Marine Terminals. The assessment was hosted by the Maryland Port Administration. The
Hampton Roads assessment was hosted by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and conducted

at their offices in Portsmouth, VA, and at the Norfolk International Terminal (NIT) in
Norfolk—one of three terminals in the Hampton Roads area.
Under Coast Guard mandate, the National Vessel Movement Center (NVMC) was
established to track notice of arrival information from ships entering all U.S. ports. The
NVMC is located in Kearneyville, WV. All cargo ships greater than 300 gross tons must
notify the NVMC at least 96 hours prior to their arrival.
For the ports of Baltimore and Hampton Roads, communications between ships and
between ship and shore are primarily by way of very high frequency (VHF) radio. All
vessels are required to monitor Channel 16 (156.8 MHz). A system of repeaters allows
VHF communications 25 miles off shore. Some vessels have satellite communication
systems. All vessels are brought into the ports by a pilot who boards the ship in open
water.
Hampton Roads Area Port
NIT, one of the Hampton Roads area facilities, operates much like a bus stop. Ships
with 2,000 to 4,000 containers arrive any hour of the day, any day of the week. A few
hundred containers may be offloaded and additional containers loaded onboard. Then,
after only 4 to 8 hours in port, the ship sails on to its next port. Most of the ships have
regular routes. Some ships (15 percent) contain break bulk cargo, which is packaged
cargo not in containers. The third type of cargo is bulk (like coal); however, NIT does not
handle bulk cargo.
Containers are loaded on and off the vessels using sophisticated cranes designed specifically
for the purpose (figure 6-7). The containers typically are loaded onto the chassis
of yard trucks that shuttle them to storage locations around the port. In some cases
“straddle carriers” are used instead of yard trucks.
Figure 6-7. Container Cranes and Stored Containers
Cranes are the key element in the operation of the terminal. The criticality of the cranes
is underscored by the fact that repair crews are kept on site at NIT at all times. Repairs
are required to be made in 15 minutes or less. Cranes have more than 100 computers and
sensors in them. Replacement parts for normally anticipated failures are warehoused on
site. However, the numbers of spares are not planned in anticipation of an EMP attack.
Each container has a unique identification number. The container number is noted
when it is unloaded from a ship. When it is placed in the yard by one of the yard trucks
(or straddle carriers), its parking place is sent to the data center in Portsmouth through a
handheld wireless computer. All the container location data are mirrored to the data center
at NIT and backed up daily. The data centers have UPS and diesel backup power. PerCRITICAL

sonnel also walk the yard to reconfirm the accuracy and completeness of the container
locations. There are typically 30,000 to 40,000 containers stored at NIT.
Eventually, the container is loaded onto a road truck or rail car for shipment to its destination.
A container number is logged whenever the container passes through the
entrance area. The final checkpoint has radiation detectors to look for radioactive materials
that might be moved out of the terminal.
Port of Baltimore
The 275-acre Seagirt Marine Terminal is exclusively a container terminal. On the land
side, containers arrive and leave primarily by truck (95 percent), even though the terminal
is adjacent to CSX railroad’s Intermodal Container Transfer Facility (ICTF). Seagirt has
seven active electric cranes for loading and unloading ship containers. Like NIT, the
Seagirt cranes rely on commercial power for their operation.
Nearby Dundalk Marine Terminal is more than twice as large (570 acres) and has a
mixture of cargo types: passengers on cruise ships, containers, roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro), and
break bulk. Dundalk does not process bulk cargo. The terminal has 10 dockside container
cranes, which are of various vintages, all older than the Seagirt cranes. The Dundalk
dockside cranes all use diesel-powered electric motors.
Dundalk docks on the channel next to Seagirt are used for ro-ro and break bulk cargos.
Ro-ro cargos include automobiles and a large assortment of farm and construction
equipment.
Both marine terminals use an assortment
of diesel- and diesel/electric-powered
equipment to move containers
around the yard and onto and off of
trucks and railroad cars. Diesel-powered
top loaders are used to move and stack
containers. Figure 6-8 shows two of the
six diesel/electric-powered rubber tire
gantries (RTG) at Seagirt. They provide
a more efficient method than the top
loaders for moving and stacking containers.
Unlike the dockside cranes,
whose motion is limited by fixed rails,
RTGs can be moved and placed strategically
around the terminal.
Information about the containers is transmitted to a central computer unit in the Seagirt
computer room using wireless handheld Teklogix units (figure 6-9). Information about
the status and storage location of each container is stored in the database using input from
the handheld units. Conversely, the handheld unit operators can download information
about any container from the central database. The container tracking systems at Seagirt
and Dundalk are highly automated. Their operation is essentially paperless, which places
heavy reliance on the integrity of the databases. To enhance reliability, all critical data are
mirrored in near-real time to a nearby backup site (about 1 mile away). In addition,
backup tapes are generated every evening. Seven days of backups are maintained at the
backup site. The computer room uses a Liebert UPS for short-term backup power. Longterm
emergency power is provided by a diesel generator. Because the current unit proved
Figure 6-8. RTG at Seagirt Marine Terminal
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure
119
to be inadequate during a lightning-induced power outage, a new diesel
generator is being installed. The new unit also will provide emergency
power to critical equipment outside the computer room.
The land side of operations at Seagirt and Dundalk Marine Terminals is
primarily concerned with controlling the ingress and egress of container
trucks. Entry is regulated by a series of manned consoles overlooking the
truck entry area (figure 6-10). Trucks pull up to speaker boxes where the
driver provides information about the company, vehicle, and business at
the terminal. Operators use remote cameras to read license plate numbers
and other vehicle identification markings.
The operator enters the information into the database and is issued a
routing slip that is printed near the speaker box. The slip looks similar to
an airline boarding pass and contains information about the truck and the
container with which it is concerned. The driver then proceeds to a
manned checkpoint directly below the entry control consoles. Here,
Seagirt personnel examine the routing slip and check the driver’s
identification before allowing the truck to proceed into the terminal to pick
up or drop off a container. A similar check is performed when the truck leaves the
terminal. All operations are entered into a database, providing real-time information on
the status of each truck and its container. There are typically 1,600 truck operations a day
at Seagirt.
Figure 6-10. Truck Control Station
EMP Vulnerability of Maritime Shipping
An EMP event could affect operations in every phase of the transfer of container cargo
from ships at sea to the highways and rails of the United States. The ability to provide
information on the cargo and crew 96 hours before reaching all ports in the United States
could be degraded by EMP-induced failures at the NVMC. Even if the NVMC is not
directly impacted by EMP, the ability of ships and their agents to communicate with the
NVMC could be affected by a failure in the telephone system.
The USCG, under the authority of the captain of the port, can allow ships into port
without a formal notification to the NVMC. The USCG would likely send one of its cut-

Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure
120
ters to contact ships at sea by VHF radio. Its crew might board the ship and escort it to
port. The choice of which ships to allow in and which to stop would be at the discretion
of the USCG. Depending on the extent of the EMP-affected areas, ships might also be
diverted to alternate ports.
Ships approved to enter port still need a pilot to navigate the inner waterways. Pilots
use their own boats to reach the ships and use VHF radios for communication. It is
unlikely that all the pilot boats and their radios would be damaged by an EMP event.
There are always some that are not operating at any given time. Pilots normally rely on
satellites for navigation, but they are capable of navigating using charts and buoys.13
An EMP event could slow down the arrival of ships to port, but it would not necessarily
stop all arrivals. This was the case for the terminals in the Hampton Roads area after
September 11, 2001. The terminals remained open, but the USCG was aggressive in
boarding and escorting ships to port.
Once container ships are in port, they
are dependent on the dockside cranes to
load and unload containers. Most of the
container cranes in the Hampton Roads
area are powered by commercial power;
the few remaining diesel-powered cranes
are being replaced by electric cranes. All
the dockside cranes at Seagirt also are powered by commercial power. The cranes using
commercial power have no backup for commercial power. Thus, loading and unloading
of containers would stop at these docks until commercial power is restored. The 10 dockside
cranes at Dundalk Marine Terminal are diesel/electric and independent of commercial
power.
EMP might damage the container cranes. The cranes have myriad electrical components—
programmable logic controllers, sensors, and motors. However, given their
height, it is likely that they are struck frequently by lightning. While repair crews and
replacement parts are kept on site at all times, these parts are unlikely to be sufficient to
meet the replacement needs after an EMP attack.
Once containers are removed from a ship, they are placed in the yard in a numbered
parking spot or in block storage, where canisters are stacked together like on a ship. Diesel
powered yard trucks and straddle carriers are used for this purpose. It is unlikely that
all of them would be damaged beyond repair by an EMP event. There are always units
that are not operating, which, based on the test data taken on automobiles and trucks,
would make them less likely to be damaged.
Equipment not damaged by EMP will be able to operate as long as it has diesel fuel.
Typically, a 10-to-20 day supply of fuel is stored at the terminals. They normally rely on
commercially powered electric pumps to move fuel out of the storage tanks, but would
improvise alternate methods if there was an extended outage of commercial power.
The actual delivery and removal of containers from the ports is dependent on outside
trucks and, to a lesser extent, railroads. Diesel/electric RTGs are used to move containers
13 Many satellites are likely to be unaffected by either EMP or by enhanced space radiation environment produced by a
high-altitude burst (see Chapter 10 of this volume), but there may be some degradation as a result of vulnerabilities
of receivers or ground stations.

Dockside cranes are electrically powered

on and off trucks and rail cars. While RTGs are the most efficient method for moving
containers, in the event they all failed, it is possible to load and unload containers with
diesel-powered top loaders. Even ordinary forklifts could be used in an emergency. Ro-ro
operations are less dependent on the operation of terminal equipment. Cranes are not used
to unload the equipment—it just rolls down a ramp. Some break bulk cargo ships have
their own cranes for dockside operations.
Container-handling equipment is only part of the port operations process. Record
keeping is as important. Each container arriving at the port must be tracked until it leaves
the port. If the records are lost, reconciling claims of lost containers could have a significant
economic impact.
The location of each canister at the Hampton Roads area ports is stored in a database at
a data center in Portsmouth. The data are mirrored to the data center at NIT and backed
up daily. Both data centers have a UPS and backup generators. They rely on telephone
lines to receive data and to communicate with each other.
It is unlikely that both data centers would be so damaged by EMP that they could not
operate. They use multiple personal computers from different manufacturers to process
the data. The NIT data center, which was visited as part of the assessment, uses Windows
® software for some applications and Macintosh® software for others. This diversity
in location, hardware, and software makes it less likely that there will be a total failure of
the data processing system.
Even if all data on the container locations were to be lost, it would be possible to regenerate
it in a few days. Personnel routinely roam the yard checking the accuracy of the
database. They compare the container’s unique number with the number of the parking
spot. These personnel could reverse the process and regenerate the database.
The arrangement is similar at the Seagirt and Dundalk Marine Terminals. They have a
central computer room with multiple servers that support the critical databases. The computer
room also contains the base station for the wireless handheld units, various routers,
and myriad telephone cables. There is no shielding that would limit EMP coupling to the
large number of cables in the room. EMP-induced upsets should be expected and damage
is certainly possible.
Critical data are mirrored to another data center about 1 mile away and backed up daily.
Both data centers have a UPS and backup generators. The backup generator at Seagirt is
inadequate to maintain operations and is being replaced with a more powerful unit that
also will provide backup power to other critical equipment, such as the speakers and
cameras at the truck gates.
It is unlikely that both of the Baltimore area data centers would be so damaged by EMP
that they could not operate. They use multiple personal computers of different generations
and from different manufacturers to process the data. The diversity in location and
hardware makes it less likely that there will be a total failure of the data processing system.
Paper records also would be needed to track the containers entering and leaving both
the land and sea sides of the port. The ports could operate at significantly reduced capacity
using a paper-based tracking system if necessary. It likely would take several days to
implement the process.
Successful recovery from an EMP event will depend greatly on the availability of
power and the ability of the USCG and port personnel to evaluate their situation and
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure
122
modify their operations accordingly. The events of September 11, 2001, and the need to
survive periodic hurricanes have fostered the type of planning needed to respond to an
EMP event. Although EMP was not directly considered, many of the plans for emergency
recovery would be helpful after an EMP event.
During the assessment, it was encouraging that people in authority were clearly capable
of responding well to unexpected situations. However, their response to an EMP event
could improve significantly if they had a better understanding of what to expect.
Commercial Aviation
Air travel has become ingrained in our way of life. There were 72 U.S.-certified airline
carriers at the end of 2002, employing 642,000 pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and
other workers. U.S. airlines carried 560 million domestic passengers during 2001, logging
some 700 billion passenger miles. In addition, U.S. airlines all carry freight to some
extent. Commercial air freight shipments totaled about 22 billion ton-miles.14
The key elements of commercial aviation infrastructure that we assessed are the air
traffic control system and the aircraft themselves.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has the responsibility for operating the
U.S. air traffic control system with an emphasis on passenger safety. The FAA rigorously
controls commercial air traffic—on the ground at airports (by airport towers), all takeoffs
and landings (by Terminal Radar Approach CONtrol—TRACONs), and all en route
travel (by air route traffic control centers—ARTCCs). Two essential parts of the FAA air
traffic control architecture are (1) command and control through communication among
controllers and between controllers and pilots, and (2) navigation aids for following
proper routes, terminal approaches, and landing.
Commercial air traffic in U.S. airspace at altitudes up to 70,000 feet is controlled at all
times. U.S. airspace is divided into 24 regions, 21 for the contiguous states and one each
for Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam. Each region is controlled by an ARTCC. These centers
provide en route control for aircraft
at altitudes above 17,000 feet,
maintaining safe separation between
aircraft and routing aircraft around
bad weather. Terminal control is
provided for aircraft at lower altitudes
and on the ground by airport
towers.
An ARTCC has an operations
room (figure 6-11) that consists of
rows (banks) of individual controllers.
The region controlled by a
center is divided into sections. Aircraft are tracked and controlled by individual controllers
and handed from controller to controller as the aircraft moves from section to section.
Control passes from ARTCC to ARTCC over a dedicated private network telecommunications
link that connects a controller from one facility to the next controller at another
14 Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
Figure 6-11. An ARTCC Operations Room

123
facility. En route control is acquired and handed off to a terminal controller in a similar
manner.
If terminal control is interrupted, en route control takes over. If an en route control
center is interrupted, control is turned over to another en route control center. These protocols
provide redundant backup capability.
Radars are used to acquire and track aircraft in support of air traffic control centers.
Generally, multiple radars will track an aircraft. Computers in air traffic control centers
process radar information to form mosaic sectional displays and pass aircraft tracking
information from center to center and across sections at a control center. Visualization is
with a cathode ray tube (CRT) screen; paper printouts are also provided and used as a
backup. Given a large number of radars with overlapping coverage, failure of a single
radar will not adversely affect commercial air operations. Simultaneous failure of multiple
radars, as could happen in an EMP attack, could shutdown all air traffic in the
affected region, possibly nationwide.
The commercial aircraft in use are primarily jet-powered aircraft constructed by Boeing
in the United States, and Airbus in Europe. In addition, there are various manufacturers
of smaller commuter aircraft.
More than any other transportation infrastructure, the commercial aviation infrastructure
is based on electronics. Everything from fly-by-wire aircraft flight control systems to
navigation, communications, engine sensors and controls, and essential ground-based
operations depends on microprocessor computer control.
Although a shutdown or curtailment of commercial aviation would have a severe, perhaps
crippling, impact on the airline industry itself, the consequences for critical infrastructures
would be less serious. Few vital economic activities are highly dependent on
the unique advantage—speed—that commercial air transport has over the various modes
of land transport.
EMP Vulnerability of the Commercial Aviation Infrastructure
Aircraft
Our commercial aircraft EMP assessment was conducted based on results of a meeting
and subsequent discussions with Boeing electromagnetics effects (EME) staff. This staff
is responsible for assuring that Boeing commercial aircraft can operate following exposure
to nonhostile electromagnetic (EM) environments. Specifically, we assessed the
amount of EMP protection that might be afforded by protection against lightning and
high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). Moreover, our assessment focused on safety of
flight and the capability to land a plane after EMP exposure. We did not address continuation
of normal flight operations, because we expect that all aircraft will be directed
to land immediately on notification of an EMP attack.
Boeing maintains a strict engineering protocol for assuring their commercial aircraft are
protected against nonhostile EM environments. This protocol includes qualification testing
that is a function of flight-critical electronics categories, application of immunity
standards to electronics boxes (sometimes referred to as line-replaceable units [LRU]),
and hardening practices tailored to specific requirements.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure
124
EME Qualification Practices for Safety-of-Flight Electronics. Boeing assigns electronics
equipment to categories to differentiate the impact of loss of function. The highest
category is reserved for electronics boxes, the failure of which would be considered
catastrophic, and could lead to potential loss of the aircraft. Because our assessment
focused on safety of flight, this is the most
important category for EMP effects.
For this category of electronic subsystems,
EME qualification is performed by a
combination of low-level system tests and
electronics box immunity tests (see next
section). The purpose of the system-level
tests is to estimate the intensity of the
electromagnetic stresses coupled to the
electronics box interfaces (connectors).
For lightning (the EM environment most
similar to EMP), the box immunity tests are then used to demonstrate that the electronics
immunity levels are at least a factor of two higher than the coupled stresses. If this margin
is not achieved, Boeing adjusts the protection tactics until this requirement is met. For
lower-criticality electronic systems, only the box immunity tests are conducted, and there
is no explicit relationship to the coupled stress required.
There has been significant evolution in the use of electronics in commercial aircraft.
For aircraft designs prior to the 777, a direct mechanical/hydraulic link to the control surfaces
was maintained, thereby minimizing electronics criticality for safety-of-flight applications.
This observation would mitigate in favor of inherent EMP immunity for the
nonelectronic subsystems. However, depending on aircraft, there are still some flightcritical
functions performed by electronics, for which EMP immunity is not known.
Therefore, even for pre-777 designs, there are insufficient data to confirm EMP immunity.
Additional testing (limited to flight-critical electronics) is required to confirm EMP
immunity. This testing should include low-level system testing to estimate EMP stresses
at electronics interfaces and the corresponding electronics immunity testing. The recommended
approach is essentially an extension of the existing lightning protocol to provide
coverage for the EMP environment.
Boeing considers the 777 to be their first fly-by-wire design, incorporating more flightcritical
electronics than used in earlier designs. Therefore, the newer designs may be
more prone to EMP safety-of-flight impact. This potential is significantly mitigated by
judicious use of redundancy for flight-critical subsystems. For example, while the flightcontrol
systems use electrical signals rather than mechanical wires for control surface
instructions, the primary digital controls are backed up by analog signals. Moreover, significant
redundancy (up to four levels) is built into each flight-control subsystem. Therefore,
the possible EMP susceptibility is offset significantly by careful, redundant design.
Nonetheless, the qualification protocols do not provide adequate coverage for anticipated
EMP responses. Therefore, as is the case for the earlier designs, additional testing is
required to confirm EMP immunity. This testing should address both the EMP stresses at
electronics interfaces and the corresponding immunity testing. Because there is more
application of electronics in the newer designs, more extensive testing will be required
than for the earlier designs.
􀂋􀂋
Although commercial aircraft have
proven EM protection against naturally
occurring EM environments, we cannot
confirm safety of flight following EMP
exposure. Moreover, if the complex air
traffic control system is damaged by
EMP, restoration of full services could
take months or longer.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 6. Transportation Infrastructure
125
EME Immunity Testing Standards. The industry standard for electronics immunity
testing for commercial aircraft is RTCA/DO-160D.15 Boeing uses an internal standard
that flows down from RTCA/DO-160D but is tailored to the company’s technical practices.
For lightning, damped sinusoid immunity testing at center frequencies of 1 and 10
MHz is required. Other EMP aircraft testing has shown that EMP response tends to be at
higher frequencies, generally in the 10 to 100 MHz range. In addition, conducted susceptibility
HIRF testing is required for frequencies covering and extending far beyond the
EMP range. However, the test amplitudes are lower than might be expected for EMP.
Therefore, EMP survivability cannot be directly inferred from commercial aircraft lightning
and HIRF immunity testing standards.
EME Hardening Practices. EME hardening in Boeing aircraft is achieved using a combination
of tactics-stress reduction (e.g., use of shielded electrical cables), redundancy of
flight-critical systems (depending on the system, up to four channels of redundancy are
applied), and software error detection/correction algorithms for digital data processing.
The combination of these tactics is adjusted to match the specific requirements of different
electronic subsystems. In addition, hardening measures may be applied to electronic
boxes to increase immunity, if required, to meet the Boeing specifications that flow down
from DO-160D.
In summary, the Boeing engineering approach for protection and qualification against
nonhostile electromagnetic environments is well established, and it is demonstrated by
experience to be sufficient for the EM environments to which the aircraft are exposed
during normal operations. While these procedures may provide significant protection in
the event of an EMP attack, this position cannot be confirmed based on the existing qualification
test protocols and immunity standards. This conclusion is applicable to all commercial
aircraft currently in service, including the earlier designs. However, it is particularly
emphasized for the newer, fly-by-wire designs that, by virtue of more reliance on
digital electronics, may be more prone to EMP effects.
Air Traffic Control
We conducted an EMP vulnerability assessment of air traffic control by discussions
with FAA engineers and former air traffic controllers and by visits to an FAA facility in
Oklahoma City and the ARTCC in Longmont, CO. Moreover, because computer networks
are integral parts of the air traffic control system, existing EMP test data on similar
COTS electronics is applicable. Our testing did not include the FAA’s private telecommunications
network links connecting the ARTCCs, such as the FAA Leased Interfacility
National Air Space Communications System (LINCS) and more recently the FAA Telecommunications
Infrastructure (FTI) Program.16 These FAA critical telecommunications
15 RTCA, Inc., is a not-for-profit corporation that develops recommendations regarding communications, navigation,
surveillance, and air traffic management system issues.
16 The FAA LINCS is a highly diverse private network constructed to meet specific requirements of a customer with
critical mission requirements. The FAA LINCS is the most available private line network in the world with an offbackbone
availability requirement of 99.8 percent. More than 21,000 circuits serve the entire network. More than
200 circuits form the LINCS backbone and satisfy diversity requirements of 99.999 percent availability. Despite
natural disasters, major failures of public infrastructures, and the 2001 terrorist attacks, the FAA LINCS survived as
designed, keeping the line of communication open between air traffic controllers and airplanes. In July 2002, the
FAA initiated a substantial modernization of its telecommunications networks to meet its growing operational and
mission support requirements and to provide enhanced security features. The new FTI Program is an integrated suite
of products, services, and business practices that provide a common infrastructure supporting the National Airspace
System (NAS) requirements for voice, data, and video services; improve visibility into network operations, service
delivery status, and cost of services; and integrate new technologies as soon as they emerge. Reference: NSTAC

networks and services are supported by a number of National Security and Emergency
Preparedness (NS/EP) programs available from the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) National Communications System (NCS).17
The main function of ARTCCs is to control air traffic in surrounding regions. Regions
are divided into sections and aircraft are monitored from section to section before being
handed off to another ARTCC or to an airport approach control center. The process is
highly computerized with quadruple computer redundancy and redundant power and
internal communication systems.
The ARTCCs are composed, in part, of computer networks based on commercial components.
Similar components have been EMP tested and have manifested latching upsets
(requiring manual intervention to restore function) beginning in the 4 kV/m peak field
range. Permanent damage has been observed in the 8 kV/m range but is more prevalent
above 15 kV/m. Based on similarity, it is anticipated that ARTCCs will begin to manifest
loss of function following EMP exposure to peak fields as low as 4 kV/m; but functions
will not be seriously degraded unless exposed to peak fields in excess of 15 kV/m.
A large number of radars have overlapping coverage. Failure of a single radar will not
significantly impact air traffic control capability. Simultaneous failure of multiple radars,
as could happen in an EMP attack, could shutdown all air traffic control in the affected
region, and possibly nationwide, thereby making it more difficult to assure safe landings.
In this case, emphasis for safe landings would shift to aircraft crew and airport towers.
Power to all critical components of the FAA system is backed by fuel generator power,
and in some instances, uninterrupted through temporary use of large UPSs. Visual flight
operations will be in the forefront for collision avoidance and landing. Many aircraft will
land at airports other than originally intended, as was the case after the 9/11 terrorist
attacks. Significant challenges arise for safe landing in conditions of low visibility in the
absence of navigation and landing aids at night and during adverse weather.
There are redundant radio communications with aircraft and redundant telephone and
microwave communications between air traffic control regions and airport towers. If
communications are lost, responsibility for safe landings will revert solely to the aircraft
crews.
If the FAA air traffic control system is damaged by exposure to EMP environments, its
reconstitution would take time. The FAA does not have sufficient staff or spare equipment
to do a mass rapid repair of essential equipment. The FAA collection of radar,
communication, navigation, and weather instruments spans 40 years. It includes components
from multiple vendors that are connected using a variety of wire, wireless, and fiber
links. Some equipment has lightning and electromagnetic interference protection.
Accordingly, configuration control is difficult. It would take days to a month or more to
bring various components of the control system back online, starting with communications,
followed with navigation aids. As the control system rebuilds, there is likely to be
significant reduction in air traffic, with constraints to increase intervals for departures,
landings, and spacing of aircraft en route. Moreover, the capability to restore the air traffic
control system is dependent on availability of services from other infrastructures. In
the event these services are compromised by an EMP attack, the air traffic control restoration
times will be extended.

Recommendations
Specific actions for each transportation infrastructure follow.
Railroads
Railroad operations are designed to continue under stressed conditions. Backup power
and provisioning is provided for operations to continue for days or even weeks at reduced
capacity. However, some existing emergency procedures, such as transferring operations
to backup sites, rely on significant warning time, such as may be received in a weather
forecast before a hurricane. An EMP attack may occur without warning, thereby compromising
the viability of available emergency procedures. Our recommendations are
directed toward mitigating this and other potential weaknesses. DHS should:
􀂋 Heighten railroad officials’ awareness of the possibility of EMP attack, occurring
without warning, that would produce wide-area, long-term disruption and damage to
electronic systems.
􀂋 Perform a test-based EMP assessment of railroad traffic control centers. Develop and
implement an EMP survivability plan that minimizes the potential for adverse longterm
EMP effects. The emphasis of this effort should be on electronic control and telecommunication
systems.
􀂋 Perform an EMP vulnerability assessment of current vintage railroad engines.
􀂋 Develop and implement an EMP survivability plan, if needed.
Trucking and Automobiles
Emphasizing prevention and emergency clearing of traffic congestion, DHS should
coordinate a government and private sector program to:
􀂋 Initiate an outreach program to educate state and local authorities and traffic engineers
on EMP effects and the expectation of traffic signal malfunctions, vehicle disruption
and damage, and consequent traffic congestion.
􀂋 Work with municipalities to formulate recovery plans, including emergency clearing
of traffic congestion and provisioning spare controller cards that could be used to
repair controller boxes.
􀂋 Sponsor the development of economical protection modules—preliminary results for
which are already available from Commission-sponsored research—that could be retrofitted
into existing traffic signal controller boxes and installed in new controller
boxes during manufacturing.
Maritime Shipping
The essential port operations to be safeguarded are ship traffic control, cargo loading
and unloading, and cargo storage and movement (incoming and outgoing). Ship traffic
control is provided by the Coast Guard, which has robust backup procedures in place.
Cargo storage and movement is covered by other transportation infrastructure recommendations.
Therefore, focusing on cargo operations in this area, DHS should coordinate
a government and private sector program to:
􀂋 Heighten port officials’ awareness of the wide geographic coverage of EMP fields, the

Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure
Introduction
A high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack can damage or disrupt the infrastructure
that supplies food to the population of the United States. Food is vital for individual
health and welfare and the functioning of the economy.
Dependence of Food on Other Infrastructures
The food infrastructure depends critically for its operation on electricity and on other
infrastructures that rely on electricity. An EMP attack could disrupt, damage, or destroy
these systems, which are necessary in making, processing, and distributing food.
Agriculture for growing all major crops requires large quantities of water, usually supplied
through irrigation or other artificial means using electric pumps, valves, and other
machinery to draw or redirect water from aquifers, aqueducts, and reservoirs. Tractors
and farm equipment for plowing, planting, tending, and harvesting crops have electronic
ignition systems and other electronic components. Farm machinery runs on gasoline and
petroleum products supplied by pipelines, pumps, and transportation systems that run on
electricity or that depend on electronic components. Fertilizers and insecticides that make
possible high yields from croplands are manufactured and applied through means containing
various electronic components. Egg farms and poultry farms typically sustain
dense populations in carefully controlled environments using automated feeding, watering,
and air conditioning systems. Dairy farms rely heavily on electrically powered
equipment for milking cattle and for making other dairy products. These are just a few
examples of how modern food production depends on electrical equipment and the electric
power grid, which are both potentially vulnerable to EMP.
Food processing also requires electricity. Cleaning, sorting, packaging, and canning of
all kinds of agricultural products are performed by electrically powered machinery.
Butchering, cleaning, and packaging of poultry, pork, beef, fish, and other meat products
also are typically automated operations, done on electrically driven processing lines. An
EMP attack could render inoperable the electric equipment and automated systems that
are ubiquitous and indispensable to the modern food processing industry.
Food distribution also depends heavily on electricity. Vast quantities of vegetables,
fruits, and meats are stored in warehouses, where they are preserved by refrigeration
systems, ready for distribution to supermarkets. Refrigerated trucks and trains are the
main means of moving perishable foods to market; therefore, food distribution also has a
critical dependence on the infrastructure for ground transportation. Ground transportation
relies on the electric grid that powers electric trains; runs pipelines and pumping stations
for gasoline; and powers signal lights, street lights, switching tracks, and other electronic
equipment for regulating traffic on roads and rails.
Because supermarkets typically carry only enough food to supply local populations for
1 to 3 days and need to be resupplied continually from regional warehouses, transportation
and distribution of food to supermarkets may be the weakest link in the food infrastructure
in the event of an EMP attack. The trend toward modernization of supermarkets
may exacerbate this problem by deliberately reducing the amount of food stored in
supermarkets and regional warehouses in favor of a new just-in-time food distribution
system. The new system relies on electronic databases to keep track of supermarket
inventories so that they can be replaced with fresh foods exactly when needed, greatly
reducing the need for large stocks of warehoused foods.

Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure

The electric power grid, on which the food infrastructure depends, has been component-
tested and evaluated against EMP and is known to be vulnerable. Moreover, power
grid blackouts induced by storms and mechanical failures on numerous occasions have
caused massive failure of supermarket refrigeration systems and impeded transportation
and distribution of food, resulting in spoilage of all perishable foods and causing food
shortages lasting days or sometimes weeks. These storm- and accident-induced blackouts
of the power grid are not likely to have consequences for the food infrastructure as severe
or as geographically widespread as an EMP attack would.
In the face of some natural disasters like Hurricane Andrew in 1992, federal, state, and
local emergency services combined have sometimes been hard pressed to provide the
endangered population with food. Fortunately, there are few known instances of actual
food starvation fatalities in the United States. In such localized emergencies as Hurricane
Andrew, neighboring areas of the disaster area are usually able to provide needed emergency
services (e.g., food, water, fire, and medical) in a timely fashion.
In the case of Hurricane Andrew, for example, although the area of the damage was
relatively small, the level of damage was extraordinary and many people were affected.
Consequently, emergency services were brought in, not just from neighboring states, but
from many distant states. For example, electric transformers were brought in from other
states to help rebuild the local power grid. The net result was a nationwide shortage of
transformers for 1 year until replacements could be procured from overseas suppliers,
who needed 6 months to build new transformers.
Hurricane Katrina, one of the greatest natural disasters ever to strike the United States,
afflicted a much larger area than Andrew. Consequently, the ability to provide food and
other emergency aid was a much greater challenge. The area disrupted by Hurricane
Katrina is comparable to what can be expected from a small EMP attack.
Recent federal efforts to better protect the food infrastructure from terrorist attack tend
to focus on preventing small-scale disruption of the food infrastructure, such as would
result from terrorists poisoning some portion of the food supply. Yet an EMP attack
potentially could disrupt or collapse the food infrastructure over a large region encompassing
many cities for a protracted period of weeks, months, or even longer. Widespread
damage of the infrastructures would impede the ability of undamaged fringe areas to aid
in recovery. Therefore, it is highly possible that the recovery time would be very slow
and the amount of human suffering great, including loss of life.
Making, Processing, and Distributing Food
The United States is a food superpower. It leads the world in production of the 10
major crops, nine of which are food sources: corn, soybeans, wheat, upland cotton, sorghum,
barley, oats, rice, sunflowers, and peanuts. The United States is also a world leader
in the production of meats, poultry, and fish. Of the world’s 183 nations, only a few are
net exporters of grain. The United States, Canada, Australia, and Argentina supply over
80 percent of the net cereal grains exported worldwide—the United States alone providing
more than half.
These U.S. exports go far toward alleviating hunger and preserving political stability in
many nations that lack the resources to feed their own populations. While most Americans
tend to take for granted the quantity and high quality of food available to them on a
daily basis, most other countries of the world regard the United States’ food infrastructure
as an enviable economic miracle.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure
131
In contrast to the United States, many of the world’s nations struggle to meet the food
demands of their populations, even though in some cases those populations are living
near or below a subsistence level. Most of the world’s 183 nations, to some degree, are
dependent on food imports. Even among the advanced nations, the United States is
exceptional for the quantity and quality of its food production.
U.S. consumers are supplied largely from domestically produced food. In 2002,
according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), some 2.1 million
U.S. farms sold about $192 billion in crops and livestock. U.S. farms have 455 million
acres under cultivation for crop production. Another 580 million acres in the United
States are pasture and range land that support raising livestock.
Raw agricultural commodities are converted to intermediate foodstuffs and edible foods
by some 29,000 processing plants located throughout the United States, according to the
Census of Manufacturers. These plants employ about 1.7 million workers, which is
approximately 10 percent of all U.S. manufacturing employment and just over 1 percent
of all U.S. employment. Most plants are small, but larger establishments account for the
major portion of shipments. The 20 largest firms in food manufacturing account for about
35 percent of shipments, while in beverage manufacturing, the 20 largest firms account
for 66 percent of shipments. The largest 50 firms account for 51 percent of food shipments
and 74 percent of beverage shipments.
Food is supplied to consumers by approximately 225,000 food stores, as well as by
farmers markets and pick-your-own farms. Away-from-home food service is provided by
approximately 850,000 establishments, including restaurants, cafeterias, fast food outlets,
caterers, and others.
To illustrate how the U.S. food infrastructure works in making, processing, and distributing
food from farm to market, here is a concrete example:
Washington State is the foremost apple producer in the United States, with more than
$850 million in annual sales and 225,000 acres of orchards, mostly in the Cascade
Mountains. A major supermarket chain contracts through a cooperative of medium-sized
apple growers in the Spokane area to grow apples.
In the course of the growing season, the Spokane apple farmers use a wide array of
farm machinery to tend their trees and to apply fertilizers and pesticides. During the harvest
season, Washington farmers employ 35,000 to 45,000 pickers to harvest their apple
crops. Hand-picked apples are loaded onto flatbed trucks and shipped to processing firms
belonging to or under contract with the chain. Apples are processed on an electrically
driven assembly line that uses a variety of electromechanical devices to clean fruit of dirt
and pesticide residue, sort and grade apples according to size and quality, wax the fruit,
and package it into 40-pound cartons.
If the apples are not to be sent to market immediately, they can be stored for up to 8
months in giant refrigerators. The chain arranges for a shipment of apples to its Maryland
distribution center, located in Upper Marlboro, which services its stores in the Washington,
D.C., area. A trucking company is contracted for the 4-to-5 day shipment of apples to
the East Coast using a refrigerated truck. The apples are offloaded at the Upper Marlboro
regional distribution center, which makes daily deliveries to the chain’s stores. A refrigerated
truck delivers apples to a Washington, D.C., supermarket. Local residents purchase
the apples.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure
132
This example of how the food infrastructure works for apples from grower to consumer
generally is the same for most foods, with differences in detail. One important difference
is that apples, compared to many other crops, are among those most dependent on manual
labor and least dependent on machinery. Yet, clearly the food infrastructure, even for the
apple, depends heavily on assembly lines, mechanical sorters and cleaners, refrigerators,
and vehicles that, directly or indirectly, cannot operate without electricity.
Vulnerability to EMP
An EMP attack could damage or destroy some fraction of the myriad electronic systems,
ubiquitous throughout the food infrastructure, that are essential to making, processing,
and distributing food. Growing crops and raising livestock require vast quantities
of water delivered by a water infrastructure that is largely electrically powered. Tractors,
planters, harvesters, and other farm equipment are fueled by petroleum products supplied
by pipelines, pumps, and transportation systems that run on electricity. Fertilizers, insecticides,
and feeds that make possible high yields from crops and livestock are manufactured
by plants requiring electric power.
Food processing—cleaning, sorting, packaging, and canning of all kinds of agricultural
and meat products—is typically an automated operation, performed on assembly lines by
electrically powered machinery.
Food distribution also depends on electricity. Refrigerated warehouses make possible
the long-term storage of vast quantities of vegetables, fruits, and meats. Road and rail
transportation depend on the electric grid that powers electric trains, runs pipelines and
gas pumps, and powers the apparatus for regulating traffic on roads and rails.
Because the United States is a food superpower with relatively few farmers, technology
is no longer merely a convenience—it is indispensable to the farmers who must feed the
nation’s population and much of the rest of the world.
In 1900, 39 percent of the U.S. population (about 30 million people) lived on farms;
today that percentage has plummeted to less than 2 percent (only about 4.5 million
people). The United States no longer has a large labor force skilled in farming that could
be mobilized in an emergency. The transformation of the United States from a nation of
farmers to a nation in which less than 2 percent of the population is able to feed the other
98 percent is made possible only by technology. Crippling that technology would be
injurious to the food infrastructure with its security depending on the characteristics of an
EMP attack.
The dependency of the U.S. food infrastructure on technology is much greater than
implied by the reduction in the percentage of farmers from 39 percent in 1900 to less than
2 percent of the population today. Since 1900, the number of acres under cultivation in
the United States has increased by only 6 percent, yet the U.S. population has grown from
about 76 million people in 1900 to 300 million today. In order for a considerably reduced
number of U.S. farmers to feed a U.S. national population that has grown roughly fourfold
from approximately the same acreage that was under cultivation in 1900, the productivity
of the modern U.S. farmer has had to increase by more than 50-fold. Technology,
in the form of machines, modern fertilizers and pesticides, and high-yield crops and
feeds, is the key to this revolution in food production. An attack that neutralized farming
technology would depress U.S. food production.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure
133
The food processing industry is an obvious technological chokepoint in the U.S. food
infrastructure. Food processing of vegetables, fruits, and all kind of meats is a highly
automated, assembly-line operation, largely driven by electric power. An EMP attack that
damages this machinery or blacks out the power grid would stop food processing. The
work force in the food processing industry is sized and trained to run a largely automated
system. In the event of an attack that stops the machines from running, personnel would
not be sufficiently numerous or knowledgeable to process food the old-fashioned way, by
hand. Depending on climate, most foods that are not refrigerated would begin to spoil in
a few hours or days.
Finally, the distribution system is probably the most vulnerable technological chokepoint
in the U.S. food infrastructure. Supermarkets typically carry only enough food to
provision the local population for 1 to 3 days. Supermarkets replenish their stocks virtually
on a daily basis from regional warehouses, which usually carry enough food to supply
a multicounty area for about 1 month.
Regional warehouses are probably the United States’ best near-term defense against a
food shortage because of the enormous quantities of foodstuffs stored there. For example,
one typical warehouse in New York City daily receives deliveries of food from more than
20 tractor trailers and redistributes to market more than 480,000 pounds of food. The
warehouse is larger than several football fields, occupying more than 100,000 square feet.
Packaged, canned, and fresh foods are stored in palletized stacks 35 feet high. Enormous
refrigerators preserve vegetables, fruits, and meats and the entire facility is temperature
controlled.
However, regional warehouses potentially are vulnerable to an attack that collapses the
power grid and causes refrigeration and temperature controls to fail. Moreover, the large
quantities of food kept in regional warehouses will do little to alleviate a crisis if it cannot
be distributed to the population promptly. Distribution depends largely on trucks and a
functioning transportation system. Yet storm-induced blackouts have caused widespread
failure of commercial refrigeration systems and massive food spoilage.
Trends in the grocery industry toward just-in-time distribution may reduce reliance on
regional warehouses and increase the vulnerability of the food infrastructure to EMP
attack. Just-in-time distribution, now being adopted by some supermarket chains in California,
Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire, uses automated databases and computer systems
to track supermarket inventories in real time and promptly replenish food inventories,
as needed, from even larger, but fewer, regional warehouses and directly from food
manufacturers.
The new system promises to supply customers with fresher foods and to greatly reduce
industry’s reliance on large inventories of stockpiled foods at regional warehouses. As
just-in-time distribution becomes the industry norm, in the event of an EMP attack,
heavier reliance on computers and databases may make it easier to disrupt the management
of food distribution, while decreased reliance on regional warehouses could greatly
reduce the amount of food available for distribution in an emergency.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure

􀂋􀂋
Pulse-current injection and free-field illumination testing on a limited number of
refrigerators and freezers indicate that some units will fail from low to moderate EMP
levels. This testing indicates that substantial numbers of people would have to survive
without benefit of refrigerated foods for an extended period, until repairs or replacement
refrigerators and freezers could be obtained. Massive food spoilage at stores and
regional warehouses is implied.
Consequences of Food Infrastructure Failure
An EMP attack that disrupts the food infrastructure could pose a threat to life, industrial
activity, and social order. Absolute deprivation of food, on average, will greatly diminish
a person’s capacity for physical work within a few days. After 4 to 5 days without food,
the average person will suffer from impaired judgment and have difficulty performing
simple intellectual tasks. After 2 weeks without food, the average person will be virtually
incapacitated. Death typically results after 1 or 2 months without food.
This timeline would not start until food stockpiles in stores and homes were depleted.
Many people have several days to weeks of food stored in their homes. For example, in
1996 when a snowstorm in the Washington, D.C., area virtually paralyzed the food infrastructure
for a week, the general population was forced to live off of private food larders
and had sufficient stores to see them through the emergency. However, a significant
number of people, those with little or no home food supply, would have to begin looking
for food immediately.
Historically, even the United States’ vast agricultural wealth has not always been
enough to protect its people from the effects of nature and bad economic decisions. Millions
of Americans knew hunger as a consequence of a drought that caused the dust bowl
years (1935 to 1938) in the Western and Central Plains breadbasket, as well as by the
Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Even today, according to the USDA,
33.6 million Americans, almost 12 percent of the national population, live in “food-insecure
households.” Food-insecure households, as defined by the USDA, are households
that are uncertain of having or are unable to acquire enough food to meet the nutritional
needs of all their members because they have insufficient money or other resources.
A natural disaster or deliberate attack that makes food less available, or more expensive,
would place at least America’s poor, 33.6 million people, at grave risk. They would
have the least food stockpiled at home and be the first to need food supplies. A work
force preoccupied with finding food would be unable to perform its normal jobs. Social
order likely would decay if a food shortage were protracted. A government that cannot
supply the population with enough food to preserve health and life could face anarchy.
In the event of a crisis, often merely in the event of bad weather, supermarket shelves
are quickly stripped as some people begin to hoard food. Hoarding deprives government
of the opportunity to ration local food supplies to ensure that all people are adequately
fed in the event of a food shortage. The ability to promptly replenish supermarket food
supplies becomes imperative in order to avoid mass hunger.
Blackouts of the electric grid caused by storms or accidents have destroyed food supplies.
An EMP attack that damages the power grid and denies electricity to warehouses or
that directly damages refrigeration and temperature control systems could destroy most of
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure
135
the 30-day regional perishable food supply. Blackouts also have disrupted transportation
systems and impeded the replenishment of local food supplies.
Federal, state, and local government agencies combined sometimes have had difficulty
compensating for food shortages caused by storm-induced blackouts. For example:
􀂋 Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 caused a protracted blackout in New Orleans and
the coastal region, destroying the food supply. Flooding, downed trees, and washedout
bridges paralyzed transportation. But the Katrina blackout by itself was sufficient
to stop transportation and prevent rapid replenishment and repair of the food infrastructure
because gas stations could not operate without electric power. An EMP
attack could also paralyze transportation of food by rendering gas pumps inoperable,
causing vehicles to fail and blacking out traffic lights, resulting in massive traffic jams.
Hurricane Katrina’s destruction of the food supply was a major contributing factor to
the necessity of mass evacuation of New Orleans and the coastal population. Because
many evacuees never returned, the protracted disruption of the food infrastructure,
which lasted weeks—and in some localities months—while the electric power grid
was being restored, was a major factor contributing to permanently reducing the
populations of New Orleans and coastal Louisiana. Hurricane Katrina’s effect on the
food infrastructure is comparable to what can be expected from a small EMP attack.
􀂋 Hurricane Lili in October 2002 blacked out the power grid in coastal Louisiana, virtually
collapsing the local food infrastructure. As a consequence of the blackout, food
was unavailable to thousands through normal means. In south Louisiana, 30 supermarkets
would not open because the blackout prevented their electric cash registers from
operating. Those stores that did open were stripped of food within hours. In Abbeville,
the parking lots of shopping centers became feeding stations run by churches and the
state Office of Emergency Preparedness. Associated Grocers, which supplies food to
supermarkets in Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, sent food in refrigerated trucks to
the area from regional warehouses.
The food emergency was reflected in a skyrocketing demand for dry ice to preserve
food stuffs during the hot weather and to preserve refrigerated foods. Local supplies of
dry ice were exhausted quickly—one store selling 20,000 pounds of dry ice to hundreds
of customers in 2 hours—and had to be supplemented with supplies from the
Red Cross.
It is important to note that no one died from food or water deprivation during this
emergency, and that the damaged area was small enough to be aided rapidly during
recovery by undamaged fringe areas.
􀂋 Hurricane Floyd in September 1999 put more than 200 supermarkets out of operation
in North Carolina. Protracted blackouts caused massive food spoilage despite emergency
efforts taken before the storm to preserve perishable goods in freezers. Floyd
blackouts also impeded replenishment of some supermarkets by inducing traffic signal
failures that contributed to massive traffic jams.
􀂋 An ice storm blacked out the Washington, D.C., area in January 1999. Warm food,
potentially a survival issue in the freezing winter conditions, was not available in most
people’s homes because electric ovens and microwaves no longer worked.
In addition, most gas-powered ovens would not work because those built since the
mid-1980s have electronic ignition and cannot be lit with a match. Some resorted to
cooking on camp stoves. Preserving refrigerated foods was also a concern that Pepco,
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure
136
the regional power authority, helped address by giving away 120,000 pounds of dry
ice, all that it had. Dry ice became a precious commodity.
􀂋 In January 1998, an ice storm caused a widespread blackout affecting parts of Ontario
and Quebec in Canada, and Maine and upstate New York in the United States. The
blackout threatened the food supply. According to press reports, “Food poisoning has
become a real threat as embattled Montrealers, unable to get to stores, eat food that has
been kept too long in refrigerators that no longer work.”
In upstate New York, the electric utility Niagara Mohawk announced that it was
focusing restoration of electric power on more populated areas “so that supermarkets,
gasoline stations, and hotels could reopen, and people in the more rural areas could
find food and shelter.” New York State Electric and Gas helped customers get to shelters
and distributed 200,000 pounds of dry ice for preserving food.
􀂋 Hurricane Andrew in August 1992 laid waste to 165 square miles in South Florida and
left 3.3 million homes and businesses without electricity. Andrew’s aftermath posed an
immediate threat to life in South Florida, in part because of damage to the food infrastructure.
Most grocery stores had been destroyed.
Massive traffic jams, caused in part by nonfunctioning signal and street lights, prevented
the surviving supermarkets from being resupplied. “More than 5,000 traffic
lights are on the blink,” the press reported. “Traffic was snarled for miles. The simplest
chore, indeed almost everything, seemed to take forever.”
To meet the crisis, tons of surplus food were distributed in the area. Nonetheless, two
weeks after the hurricane, food was still not reaching many victims.
Andrew’s blackout of the power grid made the crisis over food, water, and shelter
worse by severing communications between relief workers and victims. Without
power, there was an almost complete collapse of communications—no telephones,
radio, or television. Consequently, many people were unaware of relief efforts or of
where to go for help. Had Hurricane Andrew damaged a larger area, it is likely that
undamaged fringe areas would have been less capable of coming to the rescue, resulting
in a significant loss of life.
Storm-induced blackouts provide some basis for extrapolating the greater destructive
effects on food infrastructure likely from an EMP attack. An EMP attack is likely to
damage electric power grids and other systems over a much wider geographic area than
blackouts caused by storms; therefore, recovery from an EMP attack probably would take
longer. An EMP attack also could directly damage some electronic systems, including
refrigeration systems and vehicles, which normally would not be damaged by a blackout.
Compared to blackouts, an EMP attack could inflict damage over a wider geographic area
and damage a much wider array of equipment; consequently, recovery of the food infrastructure
from EMP is likely to be much more complicated and more protracted.
Federal, state, and local agencies combined would find it difficult to cope immediately
or even over a protracted period of days or weeks following an EMP attack that causes
the food infrastructure to fail across a broad geographic area encompassing one or more
states. Infrastructure failure at the level of food distribution because of disruption of the
transportation system, as is likely during an EMP attack, could bring on food shortages
affecting the general population in as little as 24 hours.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 7. Food Infrastructure
137
Massive traffic jams are most likely in large cities, the very areas where rapid replenishment
of the food supply at hundreds of supermarkets will be needed most urgently.
Significantly, recent famines in the developing world have occurred, despite massive
relief efforts by the international community, in large part because food relief could not
reach victim populations through their underdeveloped transportation infrastructure. An
EMP attack could, in effect, temporarily create in the United States the technological
conditions in the food and transportation infrastructures that have resulted in developing
world famines.
Recommendations
Current planning, as reflected in the President’s National Strategy for the Physical
Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, the Public Health, Security, and
Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (the Bioterrorism Act), and Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) planning documents, all appear to assume
relatively small-scale threats to the food infrastructure. Most concern is focused on terrorists’
poisoning or infecting a small portion of the food supply to cause mass panic and
public fear about the safety of all food. The FEMA Federal Response Plan for a food
shortage assumes a disaster effecting about 10,000 people: “On the fringes of the geographic
areas affected will be schools and small institutions having large inventories
estimated to be sufficient to feed up to 10,000 people for 3 days and supply their fluid
needs for 1 day.”1 Yet an EMP attack could so damage the food infrastructure that millions
of people would be at risk. Recommendations to address this risk include the
following:
􀂋 Relevant federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the
USDA, should supplement their plans to meet food emergencies by drawing on federal
food stockpiles.
􀂋 Federal food stockpiles should be sized to meet a possible large-scale food shortage in
the event of massive disruption of the national food infrastructure from an EMP attack
or other causes.
􀂋 The Federal Government should examine useful lessons learned from reviewing earlier
plans and programs, such as those during the early Cold War years, when the Federal
Government planned and prepared for food shortages on a large scale.
􀂋 The Federal Government should plan to locate, preserve, deliver, distribute, and ration
existing stockpiles of processed and unprocessed food, including food stockpiles by
the USDA and other government agencies, which will be an important component of
maintaining the food supply.
􀂋 The Federal Government should make it a priority to plan to protect, deliver, and
ration food from regional warehouses, under conditions in which an EMP attack has
disrupted the power, transportation, and other infrastructures for a protracted period.
􀂋 The Federal Government should make plans to process and deliver private and government
grain stockpiles to significantly supplement the processed food stored in regional
warehouses. According to the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistical Service, total
private grain stockpiles in the United States amount to more than 255 million metric
tons. Federal grain stockpiles held by the Commodity Credit Corporation exceed 1.7

138
million metric tons, with 1.6 million metric tons of that amount dedicated to the Bill
Emerson Humanitarian Trust for overseas emergency.
􀂋 The Federal Government should increase food stockpiles if existing stockpiles of food
appear to be inadequate.
􀂋 Contingency plans also should be made to provide significant levels of personnel and
technical support to speed the recovery of agriculture and food production from an
EMP attack.
Presidential initiatives have designated the Department of Homeland Security as the
lead agency responsible for the security of the food infrastructure, overseeing and working
with the USDA. Currently, under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency
Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) the President “is authorized and directed to assure
that adequate stocks of food will be ready and conveniently available for emergency mass
feeding or distribution” in the United States.2 However, in practice, the Stafford Act has
been used to authorize purchasing food from private sources and issuing food coupons to
be used in supermarkets in order to meet food shortages.
In some particularly dire emergencies, as during Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane
Andrew, when private sector food resources were destroyed or inadequate to meet the
crisis, the Federal Government has resorted to federal surplus foods. Many Andrew victims
were saved from hunger by Meals Ready to Eat (MRE). But the Federal Government
was surprised by Andrew, and the resort to MREs and surplus food stockpiles was a
poorly planned act of desperation that came late in the crisis. Recommendations to
achieve this initiative include the following:
􀂋 The Federal Government should consider one readily available option, which is to
grow the food stockpile to include the MREs.
􀂋 Plans should include timely distribution of mass quantities of food, which is likely to
be crucial during a shortage.
􀂋 The Stafford Act should be amended to provide for plans to locate, protect, and distribute
existing private and government stockpiles of food and to provide plans for distributing
existing food stockpiles to the general population in the event of a national
emergency.

pulse (EMP) can damage or disrupt the infrastructure that supplies water to the
population, agriculture, and industry of the United States (U.S.).
The water infrastructure depends for its operation on electricity. To the extent possible,
aqueducts, tunnels, pipelines, and other water delivery systems are designed to rely on
gravity. However, since the invention and proliferation of the electric water pump early
in the last century, urban growth, planning, and architecture have been liberated from
dependence on gravity-fed water systems. By making water move uphill, the gravity
pump has made possible the construction and growth of cities and towns in locations that,
in previous centuries, would have been impossible. Skyscrapers and high-rise buildings,
which would be impractical if dependent on a gravity-fed water system, have been made
possible by the electric pump.
Electrically driven pumps, valves, filters, and a wide variety of other electrical machinery
are indispensable for the purification of water for drinking and industrial purposes
and for delivering water to consumers. An EMP attack could degrade or damage these
systems, affecting the delivery of water to a very large geographic region.
Electrical machinery is also indispensable to the removal and treatment of wastewater.
An EMP attack that degraded the processes for removing and treating wastewater could
quickly cause public health problems over a wide area.
Supervisory and Control Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA) are critical to the running
and management of the infrastructure for delivery of pure water for drinking, for industry,
and for the removal and treatment of wastewater. SCADAs enable centralized control
and diagnostics of system problems and failures and have made possible the regulation
and repair of the water infrastructure with a small fraction of the work force required in
earlier days. As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 1, an EMP attack could damage or
destroy SCADAs, making it difficult to manage the water infrastructure and to identify
and diagnose system problems and overwhelming the small work force with systemwide
electrical failures.
The electric power grid provides the energy that runs the water infrastructure. An EMP
attack that disrupts or collapses the power grid would disrupt or stop the operation of the
SCADAs and electrical machinery in the water infrastructure. Some water systems have
emergency power generators, which could provide continued — albeit greatly reduced —
water supply and wastewater operations for a short time.
Little analysis has been conducted of the potential vulnerability of the water infrastructure
to EMP attack. However, SCADAs supporting the water infrastructure are
known not to have been hardened, or in most cases even tested, against the effects of an
EMP attack.
The electric power grid, on which the water infrastructure is critically dependent, is
known to be vulnerable to feasible levels of EMP. Moreover, blackouts of the power grid
induced by storms and mechanical failures are known to have disrupted the water infrastructure
on numerous occasions. These storm- and accident-induced blackouts of the
power grid are not likely to be as severe or as geographically widespread in their consequences
for the water infrastructure as would an EMP attack.

Federal, state, and local emergency services, faced with the failure of the water infrastructure
in a single large city, would be hard pressed to provide the population with the
minimum water requirements necessary to sustain life over a time frame longer than a
few days. They could not provide, on an extended emergency basis, the water requirements
and services, including waste removal, necessary to sustain normal habitation and
industrial production in a single large city; however, an EMP attack could disrupt the
water infrastructure over a large geographic area encompassing many cities for a protracted
period of weeks or even months.
The Water Works
Water for consumption and sanitation is taken for granted by virtually everyone in the
United States. Yet, the infrastructure for supplying pure water to the U.S. population and
industry and for removing and treating wastewater, compared to other infrastructures,
took longer to build and arguably is the most important of all infrastructures for the sustainment
of human life.
One of the most important differences between developed and underdeveloped nations
is the availability of pure water. An estimated 1.3 billion people in the developing world,
nearly one-quarter of the global population, lack access to safe drinking water and even
more, approximately 1.8 billion, lack water for sanitation. Consequently, diseases related
to impure water flourish in many underdeveloped nations, taking a devastating toll on
health and longevity. Economic development in many developing world nations is
impeded by the absence of an adequate water supply to support industry. Indeed, in some
countries, a major obstacle to development is simply the fact that the labor force has no
alternative but to spend much of its time transporting water for drinking and other
domestic uses from distant and often contaminated sources.
In contrast to the water scarcity that impedes development in much of the developing
world, the United States enjoys a healthy and growing population and economic prosperity
supported by the efficient distribution and utilization of its abundant water
resources. Freshwater consumption for all purposes averages about 1,300 gallons per
capita per day in the United States. Irrigation and cooling account for about 80 percent of
all consumption, and, in the 17 western states, irrigation alone accounts for more than 80
percent of water consumption. On average, some 100 gallons per person per day (200
gallons per person per day in the southwest) are consumed for domestic purposes such as
drinking, bathing, preparing food, washing clothes and dishes, flushing toilets, washing
cars, and watering lawns and gardens.
Drinking and cooking account for only a small fraction of the water consumed; however,
because in most cases a single water source must serve all purposes, all water consumed,
regardless of the purpose, must meet the standards for drinking water purity, as
prescribed by law.
Supporting this demand for enormous quantities of high-quality water is a vast infrastructure
that includes more than 75,000 dams and reservoirs; thousands of miles of
pipes, aqueducts, and water distribution and sewer lines; l68,000 drinking water treatment
facilities; and 19,500 wastewater treatment facilities.
A fairly small number of large drinking water and wastewater utilities located primarily
in urban areas (about 15 percent of the systems) provide water services to more than 75
percent of the U.S. population.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 8. Water Infrastructure
141
There is no single organization or system controlling the entire water infrastructure of
the United States. Rather, more than 100,000 utilities and private owners manage the
national water infrastructure. However, because water utilities provide similar services
and must meet similar standards, they all operate in much the same way.
Water supplies require collection, treatment, storage, and distribution. Surface water
such as reservoirs, lakes, and rivers generally provides water for cities. Wells tapping
underground aquifers often supply rural areas and the southwestern states. Homeowners
with private wells typically drink the water directly, because the subsurface water has
been filtered over many years within the natural underground sedimentation. Water
treatment plants are designed to provide an uninterrupted water supply that raises the
purity of surface water and aquifers to drinking standards. A typical municipal water
treatment plant purifies water through several steps: filtration, coagulation, flocculation,
sedimentation, and disinfection.
Filtration by utilities passes raw water first through coarse filters to remove sticks,
leaves, and other large debris. Finer filtration passes water through layers of sand and
other granular material to remove silt and microorganisms. This stage of treatment imitates
the natural filtration of water as it moves through the ground. This entire process is
accomplished through low-lift pumps and mechanically cleaned bar screens and fine
screens.
Coagulation is the process of removing colloidal impurities, finely suspended particles,
from the filtered water. A coagulant, such as aluminum sulfate, is thoroughly mixed into
water containing colloidal particles. Aluminum sulfate not only will coagulate and
remove colloidal particles, but also will react with calcium hydroxide in the water, forming
aluminum hydroxide, which can be removed through further filtration or
sedimentation.
Flocculation immediately follows the coagulation process to remove the finest particles
that would never settle out naturally. The velocity of the water is reduced and a gentle
mixing action is used to allow formation of insoluble salts, colloidal particles, and other
remaining suspended matter into a “floc” particle. The colloids and the coagulants mix
with each other to form a large neutral floc particle that will settle out during
sedimentation.
Sedimentation involves moving the water to large tanks to allow the floc to settle to the
bottom of the tank. Sedimentation basins or clarifiers are usually the largest tanks in the
treatment process. About 1 pound of sludge is created for every pound of chemical added
to the water for coagulation and flocculation. The sludge must be removed and disposed
of and filters and screens must be backwashed regularly.
Disinfection uses chemicals to kill any microorganisms that may have survived the filtration
process. Chlorine is the most common disinfectant. When chlorine combines with
organic material, such as dead leaves, it produces potentially dangerous trihalomethanes
(THM). Large water treatment plants in major cities often undertake an additional purification
step that reduces the level of THMs. Ozone oxidation and ultraviolet light are
other disinfectant processes that are sometimes used instead of or in addition to chlorine.
Fluoride also may be added because of its ability to retard tooth decay. Groundwater is
often aerated by bubbling air through the water or by spraying to oxidize dissolved iron
and manganese and to remove odors caused by hydrogen sulfide.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 8. Water Infrastructure
142
Treated water is delivered by high-lift pumps to the distribution system, usually
through pipelines pressurized to 40 to 80 psi, to consumers. These pumps help to maintain
water levels in storage reservoirs. Gravity flow, whenever possible, is the preferred
method for delivering water. However, most water must be delivered by means of electric
pumps. High-pressure pumps at the treatment plant deliver water to various zones within
a water district to a booster pump or series of booster pumps that completes delivery to
the consumer. High-rise buildings typically are serviced by individual booster pumps
with enough pressure to provide water to rooftop reservoirs for consumption by upper
floors and to provide water for firefighting.
Many of the same processes used in purification of drinking water also are used in
treatment of wastewater, suitably modified for the removal of the greater amounts of
material found in sewage. Sewage provides an ideal environment for a vast array of
microbes, primarily bacteria, plus some viruses and protozoa. In fact, wastewater processing
relies on benign microorganisms in the purification process. Sewage may also
contain pathogens from the excreta of people with infectious diseases that can be transmitted
by contaminated water. Waterborne diseases, while seldom a problem now in
developed nations, are still a threat in developing countries where treated water is not
available for public use.
Contaminants are generally removed from wastewater physically, biologically, and
chemically. First, rags, sticks, and large solids are removed by coarse screens to protect
the pumps. Then grit, the material that wears out equipment, is settled out in grit tanks or
chambers. At this point, most of the small solids are still in suspension and can be
removed and concentrated in the primary gravity settling tanks. The concentrated solids,
called raw sludge, are pumped to an anaerobic digester for biological decomposition. The
clarified effluent then flows to secondary treatment units for biological oxidation where
the dissolved and colloidal matter in wastewater provides nutrients for microorganisms.
A final gravity settling tank is used to remove microorganisms. This concentrated biological
sludge is removed and returned to the anaerobic digester. Chemical disinfection,
usually employing chlorine, is the last stage in the treatment of wastewater before it is
discharged.
Vulnerability to EMP
The water infrastructure is a vast machine, powered partly by gravity but mostly by
electricity. Electrically driven pumps, valves, filters, and a wide variety of other machinery
and control mechanisms purify and deliver water to consumers and remove wastewater.
An EMP attack could damage or destroy these systems, cutting off the water supply
or poisoning the water supply with chemicals and pathogens from wastewater. For
example:
􀂋 Total organic carbon (TOC) analyzers detect the levels of pollutants and pathogens in
water. Determining water quality and the kind of purification treatment necessary
depends on these sensors.
􀂋 Mechanical screens, filters, collector chains, skimmers, and backwash systems remove
sludge and other solid wastes. Failure of these systems would pollute the water and
quickly clog the pumps.
􀂋 SCADA systems enable remote control and instantaneous correction of potential problems
with water quality, delivery, and wastewater removal and treatment. This process
allows most water utilities to be nearly autonomous in operation, using a minimum
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 8. Water Infrastructure
143
number of personnel. In an emergency, such as an electrical blackout, some subsystems
have been or could easily be modified for workarounds. For example, many
valves have a manual bypass mode, and some water plants have emergency power
generators. However, the efficiencies made possible by SCADAs have reduced the
available number of trained personnel probably below the levels required for
protracted manual operation of water treatment facilities. The failure of SCADAs
would greatly impede all operations.
􀂋 High-lift and low-lift pumps are ubiquitous throughout the infrastructure for purifying
and delivering water and removing wastewater. Water cannot be purified or delivered,
nor sewage removed and treated, if these systems are damaged or destroyed.
􀂋 Paddle flocculators and other types of mixers are the primary means of chlorination
and other chemical purification. If these systems cease functioning, water cannot be
purified and likely would remain hazardous.
All of these systems depend on the electric grid for power. Large water treatment plants
consume so much electricity, in some cases about 100 megawatts, that backup generators
are impractical. For reliability, water treatment plants typically draw electricity from two
local power plants. An EMP attack that collapses the electric power grid will also collapse
the water infrastructure.
Consequences of Water Infrastructure Failure
By disrupting the water infrastructure, an EMP attack could pose a major threat to life,
industrial activity, and social order. Denial of water can cause death in 3 to 4 days,
depending on the climate and level of activity.
Stores typically stock enough consumable liquids to supply the normal demands of the
local population for 1 to 3 days, although the demand for water and other consumable
liquids would greatly increase if tap water were no longer available. Local water supplies
would quickly disappear. Resupplying local stores with water would be difficult in the
aftermath of an EMP attack that disrupts transportation systems, a likely condition if all
critical infrastructures were disrupted.
People are likely to resort to drinking from lakes, streams, ponds, and other sources of
surface water. Most surface water, especially in urban areas, is contaminated with wastes
and pathogens and could cause serious illness if consumed. If water treatment and sewage
plants cease operating, the concentration of wastes in surface water will certainly increase
dramatically and make the risks of consuming surface water more hazardous.
One possible consequence of the failure of water treatment and sewage plants could be
the release of sludge and other concentrated wastes and pathogens. Typical industrial
wastes include cyanide, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and other toxic chemicals.
Boiling water for purification would be difficult in the absence of electricity. Even most
modern gas stoves require electricity for ignition and cannot be lighted by match. In any
event, gas also may not be available to light the stoves (see Chapter 5). Boiling could be
accomplished by open fires, fueled by wood or other flammables. Other possible mitigators
are hand-held pump filters, water purification kits, iodine tablets, or a few drops of
household bleach.
A prolonged water shortage may quickly lead to serious consequences. People
preoccupied with finding or producing enough drinking water to sustain life would be
unavailable to work at normal jobs. Most industrial processes require large quantities of
water and would cease if the water infrastructure were to fail.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 8. Water Infrastructure

Demoralization and deterioration of social order can be expected to deepen if a water
shortage is protracted. Anarchy will certainly loom if government cannot supply the
population with enough water to preserve health and life.
The many homeowners with private wells also would face similar problems. There
would be fewer workarounds to get their pumps operating again, if the pump controller is
damaged or inoperable. Even if power is restored, it is unlikely the average homeowner
would be technically competent to bypass a failed pump controller and figure out how to
power the pump with bypass power lines.
The first priority would be meeting personal water needs. Federal, state, and local
governments do not have the collective capability, if the water infrastructure fails over a
large area, to supply enough water to the civilian population to preserve life.
Storm-induced blackouts of the electric grid have demonstrated that, in the absence of
electric power, the water infrastructure will fail. Storm-induced blackouts have also demonstrated
that, even in the face of merely local and small-scale failure of the water infrastructure,
the combined efforts of government agencies at all levels are hard pressed to
help. For example:
􀂋 Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 collapsed the water infrastructure in New Orleans
and coastal Louisiana. The Katrina-induced blackout stopped the vast machinery for
purifying and delivering water to the population. Water supplies were contaminated.
The National Guard, among other resources, had to be mobilized to rush water and
mobile water purification systems to the afflicted region. The water crisis—which was
protracted because the blackout was protracted, the electric power grid requiring
weeks and in some places months to repair—was a major contributing factor to the
mass evacuation of the regional population. Once evacuated, many never returned.
Thus the loss of water resources was a significant factor contributing to permanently
reducing the population in the region. The effects of Hurricane Katrina on the water
infrastructure are comparable to what can be expected from a small EMP attack.
􀂋 Hurricane Lili in October 2002 blacked out the power grid in coastal Louisiana. With
no electricity, water pumps no longer worked, depriving the population of running
water. Local bottled water supplies were quickly exhausted. Federal and state authorities
resorted to using roadside parking lots and tanker trucks as water distribution
centers.
􀂋 In September 1999, Hurricane Floyd blacked out electricity, causing water treatment
and sewage plants to fail in some Virginia localities and, most notably, in Baltimore,
Maryland. For several days, blackout-induced failure of Baltimore’s Hampden sewage
facility raised concerns about public health. With its three pumps inoperable, Hampden
spilled 24 million gallons of waste into Baltimore’s Jones Falls waterway and the
Inner Harbor.
􀂋 An ice storm in January 1999 blacked out Canada’s Ontario and Quebec provinces,
causing an immediate and life-threatening emergency in Montreal’s water supply,
which depends on electricity for filtration and pumping. On January 9, the two water
treatment plants that served 1.5 million people in the Montreal region failed, leaving
the area with only enough water to last 4 to 8 hours. Government officials kept the
water crisis secret, fearing public knowledge would exacerbate the crisis by water
hoarding and panic. But as household water pipes went dry and reports of a water
shortage spread, hoarding happened anyway and bottled water disappeared from
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 8. Water Infrastructure
145
stores. Warnings not to drink water without boiling it proved pointless, because people
had no other way of getting water and no way to boil it in the mid-winter blackout.
Montreal officials feared not only a shortage of drinking water, but also an inadequate
supply of water for fighting fires. The Montreal fire department prepared to fight fires
with a demolition crane instead of water, hoping that, if a building caught fire, the conflagration
might be contained by demolishing surrounding structures. So desperate was
the situation that provincial officials considered evacuating the city. Fortunately,
Hydro-Quebec, the government’s electric utility, managed to restore power to the filtration
plants and restore water service before such extreme measures became
necessary.
􀂋 In August 1996, a heat wave blacked out parts of the southwestern United States.
Water supplies were interrupted in some regions because electric pumps would not
work. Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Nevada, Texas, and Idaho experienced blackout-
induced disruption in water service during the heat wave. In Fresno, where most of
the city received water from wells powered by electric pumps, the city manager
declared a local emergency. Only two of the city’s 16 fire stations had water, and most
of the fire hydrants were dry. Tankers were rushed in to supplement the fire
department’s water supply.
􀂋 Hurricane Andrew in August 1992 caused a blackout in South Florida that stopped
water pumps from working. The blackout denied running water to hundreds of thousands
of people stranded among the ruins left by Andrew, amidst Florida’s summer
heat. To meet the immediate crisis more than 200,000 gallons of water were
distributed. However, without electricity to power radio or television sets, mass
communication virtually ceased to exist, and people were unaware of relief efforts or
where to seek help. Thousands may have been saved from dehydration by pyramids of
bottled water on street corners made free for the taking and by survivors who spread
the word.
In all the examples cited, timely emergency services to provide water prevented loss of
life from dehydration. However, had the outages lasted longer and the blacked-out areas
been larger, the outcome could have been very different. Storms are merely suggestive of,
and provide some basis for extrapolating, the greater destructive effects on water
infrastructure likely from an EMP attack.
Storm-induced blackouts and their effects on the water infrastructure are an imperfect
analogy to EMP attack. Taken at face value, storm-induced blackouts and their consequences
for the water infrastructure grossly understate the threat posed by an EMP attack.
Storms are much more limited in geographic scope compared to an EMP attack. Power
grid and water infrastructure recovery from storms, compared to recovery from an EMP
attack, is likely to happen more quickly because of the “edge effect”—the capability of
neighboring localities and states to provide recovery assistance. Because an EMP attack
is likely to damage or disrupt electronics over a much wider geographic area than storminduced
blackouts, rescuers from neighboring states and localities would face a much
bigger job, and recovery of the water infrastructure would take a much longer time.
Nor do storm-induced blackouts replicate the damage from an EMP attack that may
occur in small-scale electronic systems critical to the operation of the water infrastructure,
such as electric pumps, SCADAs, and motor controls for filters and valves. Compared
to storms, an EMP attack is likely to inflict not only more widespread damage geoCRITICAL

graphically, but also deeper damage, affecting a much broader array of electronic equipment,
which will contribute to a more complicated and protracted period of recovery.
Recommendations
A Presidential Directive establishes new national policy for protection of our nation’s
critical infrastructures against terrorist threats that could cause catastrophic health effects.
National-level responsibilities have already been assigned to the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect the
water infrastructure from terrorist threats. The EPA is the designated lead agency for
protection of drinking water and water treatment systems. Under this directive:
􀂋 DHS and EPA should ensure that protection includes EMP attack among the recognized
threats to the water infrastructure.
􀂋 The following initiatives should be amended:
— The President’s National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures
and Key Assets (February 2003), which details a plan for protecting the United
States’ critical infrastructures, including the infrastructure for water. The President’s
plan:
􀁨 Identifies threats to the water infrastructure as: “Physical damage or destruction
of critical assets…actual or threatened contamination of the water supply…cyber
attack on information management systems…interruption of services from
another infrastructure.”
􀁨 Directs the EPA to work with the DHS, state and local governments, and the
water sector industry to: “Identify high-priority vulnerabilities and improve site
security…improve sector monitoring and analytic capabilities…improve sectorwide
information exchange and coordinate contingency planning…work with
other sectors to manage unique risks resulting from interdependencies.”
􀁨 Focuses on terrorism and threats other than EMP, but lends itself well (in
particular, its structure and logic) to addressing any threat, and should be
amended to include EMP.
— The Public Health and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002
(Bioterrorism Act), signed into law by President Bush on June 12, 2002. The Bioterrorism
Act:
􀁨 Requires the authorities over many drinking water systems to conduct vulnerability
assessments, certify and submit copies of their assessments to the EPA, and
prepare or revise their emergency response plans.
􀁨 Is concerned with terrorist contamination of drinking water with chemical or biological
agents.
􀁨 Could be amended to address the greater bio-chemical threat that an EMP attack
potentially poses to the water supply than any of the threats envisioned in the
Bioterrorism Act because an EMP attack that causes SCADAs in water treatment
facilities to malfunction could release biochemical agents, and conceivably contaminate
water supplies over a very wide region.
􀂋 DHS and EPA should follow the government-recommended emergency preparedness
steps applicable to a wide range of civil emergencies arising from different threats.
These steps include assuring availability of water during emergencies. To that end, the
government has recommended that citizens stockpile both water supplies and means of
purification. Implementing these recommendations will provide some measure of
preparation for an EMP threat to the water supply.

Chapter 9. Emergency Services
Introduction
Emergency services are essential to the preservation of law and order, maintenance of
public health and safety, and protection
of property. Americans have come to rely
on prompt and effective delivery of fire,
police, rescue, and emergency medical
services through local government systems.
Backing up these local systems are state capabilities (e.g., state police and National
Guard) and specialized capabilities such as those provided by the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, and other federal entities.
The demand for emergency services is large. Across the United States more than 200
million 9-1-1 calls are fielded annually.1 Responding to these calls is an army of some
600,000 local law enforcement officers, 1 million firefighters, and more than 170,000
emergency medical technicians and paramedics.2 Anticipated expenditures over the next
5 years for emergency response services are estimated at $26 billion to $76 billion at the
state and local levels, supplemented by an additional $27 billion at the federal level.3
Emergency services at all levels are receiving increased emphasis as a consequence of
the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The focus is on preventing and responding to
terrorism, including nuclear attack, but
little emergency services planning specifically
considers electromagnetic pulse
(EMP) attack.
The primary focus in this chapter is on local emergency services systems. In particular,
this chapter focuses on the communications systems to alert, dispatch, and monitor those
emergency services. The great majority of resources are concentrated at the local level;
state and federal assistance will likely be quite thin, given the large geographic extent of
an EMP attack.
In addition to local emergency systems, we also address the federal Emergency Alert
System (EAS), designed to serve the President and other leaders in communicating with
the public in emergency situations. Although no President has ever used the EAS, it is
reasonable to anticipate that it would be used in the event of an EMP attack.

Calls for assistance come in on cellular and land telephone lines to 9-1-1 operators at
centers known as Public Safety Answering Points (PSAP). PSAPs typically include one
or more 9-1-1 operators and dispatchers, communications equipment, computer terminals,
and network servers. The 9-1-1 operator determines the service required and forwards
the information for dispatch of the appropriate response units.
In addition to standard landline telephone service, emergency services employ a variety
of wireless communication systems, including radio systems, cellular and satellite telephone
systems, paging systems, messaging systems, and personal digital assistants.
Because of dead zones and restrictions on radiated power levels in communications
paths, radio repeaters are often used to relay voice and message traffic.
Because networks in nearby communities generally operate on different frequencies or
channels to avoid interference, PSAP personnel use special equipment to handle community-
to-community communications. If an emergency or public safety activity requires
close and continuous coordination among several communities or agencies, an interop-

erability switch is used to allow direct communications among organizations.
Interoperable communications across separate political jurisdictions is still a problem and
under development in most regions.
For more serious emergencies, the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) serves as a
central communications and coordination facility to which multiple organizations can
send representatives. It facilitates efficient coordination across emergency services
departments and state and federal agencies.
The Emergency Alert System
The original motivation for the EAS (previously the Emergency Broadcast System and
initially Control of Electromagnetic Radiation [CONELRAD]) was to provide the President
the ability to communicate directly with the American people in time of crisis, especially
enemy attack. Although it has never been used for that purpose, it has been activated
in local emergencies and is widely used for weather alerts. The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) sets requirements through regulation of television and radio
stations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of DHS, provides
administrative oversight.
In the case of a national emergency, a message is relayed from the President or his
agent to high-power amplitude modulation (AM) radio stations, known as national primary
stations, across the country. These stations broadcast signals to other AM and frequency
modulation (FM) radio stations, weather radio channels, and television stations
that, in turn, relay the message to still other stations, including cable television stations.
These stations use encoders and decoders to send and receive data recognized as emergency
messages.
Impact of an EMP Attack
In a crisis, the priorities for emergency services are protection of lives, protection of
property, effective communication with the public, maintenance of an operational EOC,
effective communication among emergency workers, and rapid restoration of lost infrastructure
capabilities. An EMP attack will adversely affect emergency services’ ability to
accomplish these objectives in two distinct ways: by increasing the demand for services
and by decreasing the ability to deliver them.
Demand for Emergency Services
The demand for emergency services
will almost certainly increase dramatically
in the aftermath of an EMP attack.
These demands fall into two broad categories:
information and assistance. The
absence of timely information and the inability of recovery actions to meet the demand
for emergency services will have grave consequences.
Large-scale natural and technological disasters that have occurred in the last several
decades demonstrate that information demands are among the first priorities of disaster
victims. At the onset of a disaster, an individual is concerned primarily with his or her
personal well-being and that of close family members and friends. The next most pressing
concern is for information regarding the event itself. What happened? How extensive
is the damage? Who was responsible? Is the attack over? A less immediate priority is for
􀂋􀂋
The demand for emergency services will
almost certainly increase dramatically in
the aftermath of an EMP attack.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 9. Emergency Services

information regarding recovery. How long will it take to restore essential services? What
can and should I do for self-preservation and to contribute to recovery? It is important to
recognize that emergency services providers also need all this information, for the same
reasons as everyone else and also to manage recovery operations efficiently and perform
their missions. Information assurance for emergency services requires reliable communications
supporting the transport of emergency services such as enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-1).4
As discussed in Chapter 3, Telecommunications:
Based upon results of the Commission-sponsored analysis, an EMP attack would
disrupt or damage a functionally significant fraction of the electronic circuits in
the Nation’s civilian telecommunications systems in the region exposed to EMP.
The remaining operational networks would be subjected to high levels of call
attempts for some period of time after the attack, leading to degraded telecommunications
services.
To meet the demand for priority national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP)
services supporting first responders, the FCC and the DHS’s National Communications
System (NCS) offer a wide range of NS/EP communications services that support qualifying
federal, state, and local government, industry, and nonprofit organization personnel
in performing their NS/EP missions, including E9-1-1 PSAPs.5,6
The demand for assistance will increase greatly in the event of an EMP attack. The possibility
of fires caused by electrical arcing resulting from an EMP attack cannot be ruled
out. There is no reliable methodology to predict the frequency of such fires. As with other
EMP effects, however, they will occur near-simultaneously, so that even a small number
could overwhelm local fire departments’ ability to respond. Fires indirectly caused by an
EMP attack, principally because of people being careless with candles used for emergency
lighting or with alternative heating sources during power blackouts, are also a
concern.
There also exists the possibility of EMP-caused airplane crashes.7 The average daily
peak of air traffic in U.S. airspace includes more than 6,000 commercial aircraft carrying
some 300,000 passengers and crew. Commercial aircraft are protected against lightning
strikes but not specifically against EMP. The frequency composition of lightning and
EMP differ enough so that lightning protection does not ensure EMP protection. On the
other hand, the margins of safety for lightning protection imposed on commercial aircraft
may provide flight safety in the event of an EMP attack. In any event, we cannot rule out
the possibility of airplane crashes.
Debilitating EMP effects on the air traffic control system will also be a contributing
factor to airplane crashes.
Emergency rescue services can be expected to experience an increase in demand. People
trapped on subways and in elevators will require timely rescue. If electric power is
interrupted for any period of time, people at home who depend on oxygen concentrators,
respirators, aspirators, and other life-sustaining equipment that require electric power will
need to find alternative solutions quickly. Home backup systems, including oxygen tanks,
liquid oxygen supplies, and battery and generator power, will lessen the need for an

immediate response for those fortunate enough to have them, but eventually all these
people will need to be transported to facilities with a reliable power source and appropriate
equipment. If power is out for more than several days, people dependent on dialysis
machines, nebulizers, and other life-supporting medical devices also will be at risk.
Finally, inability to replenish home supplies of medicines will eventually lead still more
people to depend on emergency services.
Police services will be stretched extremely thin because of a combination of factors.
Police will be called on to assist rescue workers in removing people from immediate dangers.
Failures of automobiles and traffic control systems with attendant massive traffic
jams will generate demands for police services for traffic management. Antisocial
behavior also can occur following a chaotic event. Though it is more commonly seen in
disasters originating from conflict, such as riots, than from natural or technological disasters,
opportunistic crime (because of failures of electronic security devices, for example)
is a potential reaction to an EMP attack. While not as prevalent as may be perceived,
far worse antisocial behavior such as looting also could occur, especially in communities
that experience conflict because of shortages or in areas that experience high crime rates
under nondisaster circumstances. If looting or other forms of civil disorder break out, it is
likely that local police services will be overwhelmed. In that event, deployment of
National Guard forces, imposition of curfews, and other more drastic measures may be
necessary.
Although emergency services could be
completely overwhelmed in the aftermath
of an EMP attack, it is important to recognize
that the demand for emergency
services could be ameliorated somewhat
by citizen groups that frequently emerge in the aftermath of disasters to lead or assist in
recovery efforts. In the absence or failure of government-provided emergency services,
these groups may take on roles similar to those services, for example, by moving and
providing basic household necessities to families in need, clearing debris, or serving as an
impromptu communications network. This example of prosocial behavior is not uncommon
in the aftermath of natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, or earthquakes. This
was seen following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when thousands of New
York citizens volunteered to give blood, help firefighters and police at the World Trade
Center grounds, and assist in other ways.
On the other hand, when the failure of police and emergency services becomes protracted,
the lawless element of society may emerge. For example, Hurricane Katrina in
August 2005 damaged cell phone towers and radio antennas that were crucial to the
operation of emergency communications. Protracted blackout of the power grid caused
generators supporting emergency communications to exhaust their fuel supplies or fail
from overuse. Consequently, government, police, and emergency services were severely
impacted in their ability to communicate with the public and with each other. Looting,
violence, and other criminal activities were serious problems in the aftermath of Katrina.
In one instance, the Danziger Bridge incident8, members of a repair crew came under fire.
Police called to the scene returned fire, and a number of people were killed. An EMP

attack is likely to incapacitate the same nodes—cell phone towers and radio antennas—
and overtax generators supporting emergency communications for a protracted period,
creating the same conditions that incited lawless behavior in the aftermath of Katrina.
EMP Effects on Emergency Services
Some equipment needed to perform
emergency services will be temporarily
upset or directly damaged by an EMP
attack, resulting in diminished capabilities
during the time of greatest demand.
Little, if any, emergency services equipment has been hardened specifically against EMP
and thus may be vulnerable. On one hand, both communications equipment and vehicles
commonly employed in the emergency services infrastructure generally have been
designed to cope with the increasingly dense everyday electromagnetic environment from
radio, television, wireless communications, radar, and other man-made sources. On the
other hand, emergency services rely on radios to transmit and receive voice and message
traffic using many frequencies, including the same frequencies contained in EMP radiation
fields. Whether or not this results in degradation depends on the effectiveness of any
built-in protection devices in these radios as well as the internal robustness of the radio
itself.
To gauge the degree of vulnerability of emergency services to EMP, the Commission
conducted an assessment of emergency services equipment and associated networks.9 We
tested a representative variety of key electronics-based equipment needed by national
leadership, first responders, and the general population. In most cases, only one of each
model was tested, so statistical inferences are not possible from our test data. Moreover, a
more robust assessment would test equipment under a range of conditions (such as different
orientations, equipment operating modes, and test waveforms). Thus, our assessment
should be viewed as indicative, rather than definitive. Notwithstanding these caveats,
these tests are the most comprehensive recent vulnerability tests of emergency services
equipment to date.
Our testing concentrated on items that were found to be critical for local emergency
services and the EAS. The testing used standard EMP test practices, including radiated
pulse and direct current injection test methods. Large-scale and smaller radiated pulse
simulators were used to illuminate the equipment with an approximation of the electromagnetic
field generated by an actual EMP event. A second test method, known as pulse
current injection, accounted for the stresses coupled to long lines such as power feeds that
cannot be accurately tested in a radiated simulator. We also used the results of relevant
past EMP testing efforts.
Public Safety Answering Points. The key elements of a PSAP include commercial telephone
links for incoming 9-1-1 calls, computer-aided dispatch, public safety radio, and
mobile data communications. There are other elements associated with PSAPs, but this is
the minimal set necessary to provide emergency response to the public.
Computers are essential to normal PSAP operations. Recent personal computer equipment
tests covered a wide technology range, consistent with what is typically in use in

PSAPs. Results indicate that some computer failures can be expected at relatively low
EMP field levels of 3 to 6 kilovolts per meter (kV/m). At higher field levels, additional
failures are likely in computers, routers, network switches, and keyboards embedded in
the computer-aided dispatch, public safety radio, and mobile data communications
equipment.
A variety of mobile radios were tested in the stored, dormant, and operating states, in
both handheld and vehicle-mounted configurations. Consistent with older test data,10
none of the radios showed any damage with EMP fields up to 50 kV/m. While many of
the operating radios experienced latching upsets at 50 kV/m field levels, these were correctable
by turning power off and then on. However, most of the fixed installation public
safety radio systems include telecommunication links between the computer-aided dispatch
terminals and the main or repeater radio units. Therefore, because of computer failures
in dispatch equipment, communication system failures might occur at EMP field
levels as low as 3 to 6 kV/m.
Based on these results, we anticipate that several major functions of PSAPs will be
affected by an EMP attack. The significance and duration of the impact of these failures
will depend on multiple factors such as the ability of technical staff to repair or replace
damaged equipment and the existence of plans and procedures to cope with the specific
type of failure. For example, based on a review of representative Y2K public safety
contingency plans, loss of the computer-aided dispatch capability can be overcome by the
use of simple note cards for manually recording the information needed for dispatch.
However, loss of the mobile radio communications or the incoming commercial
telecommunications functions could be more difficult to counteract. Typically, local
jurisdictions rely on nearby PSAPs or alternate locations to overcome these types of failures.
In an EMP attack, these contingency plans may fail because of the wide area of
effects.
Interoperability Switches. These switches are contained in many PSAPs to facilitate
direct communications among local, regional, and state public safety departments and
federal agencies after major disasters. The main elements of the interoperability switch
capability are the public safety radios, the switch unit itself, and the computer network
link between the switch unit and the dispatch console. The public safety radios that were
tested as part of this assessment were based on the equipment used in a fully operational
interoperability switch.11 The testing was performed with the equipment in stored, dormant,
and operating states. No failures were experienced at test levels up to 50 kV/m. The
interoperability switch was also tested up to 50 kV/m with no adverse effects.
Based on these results, the interoperability switch capability is expected to function
normally after an EMP attack. However, the computer network link between the interoperability
switch and the dispatch station may fail at field levels as low at 3 to 6 kV/m.
This would necessitate manual operation of the switch to implement the connections
among various law enforcement, fire, and EMS agencies.
Vehicles. Emergency service vehicles include police cars, fire trucks, and EMS
vehicles. An extensive test of a police car was performed. The most severe effect found

was the latch-up of a mobile data computer at approximately 70 kV/m. After rebooting,
the computer functioned normally.
Electronic equipment found on many of the mobile units also was tested. This equipment
included a computer, personal data assistant, mobile and portable radios, defibrillators,
and vital signs monitors. No permanent failures were experienced at levels up to 70
kV/m. Thus, we anticipate that the electronics in emergency services mobile units will
continue to function normally, but they may suffer some initial effects due to latching
upset of electronic devices.
Emergency Operation Centers. A site survey was performed at the Virginia state EOC.
The survey confirmed that the vast majority of EOC communications depends on the
Public Telecommunications Network (PTN). Thus, the ability of the EOC personnel to
communicate and therefore provide emergency coordination will be highly dependent on
the capability of the public telecommunications infrastructure to operate after an EMP
event.
EOCs typically have at least one FEMA-owned and -maintained high-frequency (HF)
radio for connectivity among national, regional, and state EOCs. The survivability of
these HF radio units was not assessed. However, the operating band of these radios is one
factor that makes them potentially vulnerable to EMP attack. Backup communications
links may include satellite telephone systems and capabilities provided by amateur radio
operator organizations.
EOCs also contain electronic equipment such as personal computers and digital data
recorders. As with PSAPs, the capabilities supported by such equipment are vulnerable to
EMP field levels as low as 3 to 6 kV/m.
Some EOCs are located below ground, which provides some protection from radiated
EMP fields. However, conductive lines penetrating into these facilities must still be protected
to ensure EMP survivability.
The Emergency Alert System. The primary method of initiating an emergency alert
message involves the use of multiple commercial telecommunications lines. Therefore,
the ability to provide emergency alert messages depends first on the status of the commercial
telecommunications system. Broadcast of an alert message and receipt by the
affected public depends on several electronic systems, including commercial radio and
television stations, EAS multimodule receivers and encoders/decoders, and commercial
radio and television receivers.
We performed site surveys of both a radio station and a television station. Backup
power generators and spare transmitter equipment were found at both facilities. While not
all commercial broadcast stations include such backup systems, the EAS has significant
redundancy; some, but not all, broadcast stations are necessary for successful transmission
of an emergency alert message.
We tested commonly used multimodule receiver and encoder/decoder units. The AM
receiver module in its dormant mode failed at a field level of 44 kV/m. The FM receiver
module exhibited erratic signal levels at 50 kV/m. No other effects were noted in testing
EAS-specific equipment.
Four different television sets and two different radio receivers were tested. The vehicle
testing performed for the transportation infrastructure assessment also tested radios in
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 9. Emergency Services
155
vehicles. In one AM radio installed in a vehicle, a malfunction occurred at approximately
40 kV/m. All other items showed no malfunctions.
Based on these results, we expect that the EAS will be able to function in near-normal
fashion following an EMP attack. The major impact that might occur is a delay in initiation
and receipt of an alert message because of (1) the dependency on the commercial
telecommunications system, (2) the loss of some receiver channels for the EAS equipment,
(3) the potential loss of some radio and television stations from power loss or damage
to transmitter components, and (4) the loss of some AM radio receivers.
Interdependencies. In addition to direct damage, emergency services will be degraded
to the extent that they are dependent on other infrastructures that are themselves damaged
by the EMP attack. Emergency services are most directly dependent on the electric
power, telecommunications, transportation, and fuel infrastructures. Fire departments also
are dependent on the availability of water. EMP damage to these infrastructures can seriously
degrade emergency services.
Of particular importance, emergency services are heavily dependent on the ability of
the Nation’s PTN to process 9-1-1 calls in a timely manner. After an EMP event, the PTN
is likely to experience severe delays in processing calls.12 Since 9-1-1 calls are processed
using the same PTN equipment as non-9-1-1 calls (until they reach special 9-1-1 callprocessing
equipment located in a tandem central office assigned to each PSAP), they
will be subject to delays similar to those for nonemergency calls. In the short term, this
will result in a large number of lost 9-1-1 calls. After several days, the operation of the
PTN is expected to return to near normal, assuming no adverse effects from either
extended widespread power outages or from an inability to replenish fuel supplies for
backup generators. However, in the event of a widespread power outage that extends
beyond the time that backup power is available or commercial power service is restored,
the PTN’s ability to process 9-1-1 calls will again degrade. Eventually, extended widespread
power outages will result in an inability to replenish fuel supplies, essentially
causing a complete loss in PTN capability to process any 9-1-1 calls.
Loss of power can also directly impact PSAP operations. In the short term, the loss of
commercial power will impact local emergency services more from the standpoint of
increased calls for assistance than from functional impact. Most PSAPs and EOCs have
backup power generators that will allow uninterrupted operation for some time period.
Long-term power outages might result in the loss of PSAPs and EOCs because of an
inability to refuel the backup generators.
Consequences
The ultimate consequences of an
increased demand for emergency services
and a concomitant degradation in emergency
services capabilities are measured
in lives lost, health impaired, and property
damaged. We have no way of accurately
estimating these consequences; we can only cite suggestive statistics.

CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 9. Emergency Services
156
Most importantly, we note that the lives and health of many people depend on medical
technologies that, in turn, depend on electric power. People will turn to emergency services
if that power is unavailable for an extended period.
Emergency medical services respond to approximately 3 million 9-1-1 calls annually
for people with cardiac problems and 2.5 million others for respiratory problems.13
Fire departments responded to 1,687,500 fires in 2002. These fires resulted in property
damage estimated at $10.3 billion and 3,380 civilian deaths.14 Lives and property saved
by fire departments are undoubtedly also very large numbers.
Other direct consequences would result from the inability to successfully place a 9-1-1
call. Missed 9-1-1 calls can result from any number of causes, including (1) PTN outages;
(2) EMP-induced damage to PSAPs, PSAP repeaters, mobile communications, or other
critical support equipment; and (3) failure of commercial or residential telephone
equipment.
The principal indirect consequences of a decline or collapse of emergency services are
a result of a reduction in the availability of the work force. We did not attempt to quantify
this effect, but note that it includes not only those directly affected, but also those who
must now support those who previously would have depended on emergency services.
Recommendations
Our recommended strategy for protection and recovery of emergency services emphasizes
the establishment of technical standards for EMP protection of critical equipment
and the inclusion of EMP in planning and training.
The technology for critical emergency services functions is undergoing extensive
change, creating an excellent opportunity for inclusion of our recommended protection
measures. This technology change is propelled in large part by the need for additional
emergency services communications capability and the recognition that large-scale disasters,
such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, require extensive coordination
across the full spectrum of emergency services providers.
Our strategy can be realized through implementation of the following recommendations:
􀂋 DHS and state and local governments should augment existing plans and procedures to
address both immediate and long-term emergency services response to EMP attack.
Plans should include provisions for a protection and recovery protocol based on graceful
degradation and rapid recovery that emphasizes a balance between limited hardening
and provisioning of spare components. Such a plan should ensure the following:
— The National Emergency Number
Association should establish guidelines
for operability and recovery of
PSAPs during and after exposure to
EMP.
— The FCC should task the Network
Reliability and Interoperability Council
to address the NS/EP services,

such as E9-1-1, and identify best practices to prevent, mitigate, and recover from an

and federal departments and agencies to ensure the EMP survivability of
critical emergency services networks and equipment. To accomplish this, the DHS
should take the following actions:

entities, develop a set of EMP recovery scenarios that include coordinated attacks
involving EMP and other more widely understood threats involving weapons of
mass destruction.
— In coordination with relevant government agencies, work with the appropriate standards
entities (e.g., the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials, the
National Emergency Number Association, and the International Electrotechnical
Commission) to establish EMP immunity standards and guidelines for critical
emergency services equipment.
— Develop training courses for emergency services providers on how to enhance
immunity to, operate during, and recover from an EMP attack.
— Develop an EMP attack consequence assessment tool to perform planning analysis
and training and to assist in the identification of critical equipment and manpower
requirements.
— Establish a program to assess the vulnerability of evolving emergency services networks
and electronics equipment to EMP and to develop a model plan for hardness
maintenance and surveillance for implementation by state and local jurisdictions.

Chapter 10. Space Systems
Introduction
Over the past few years, there has been increased focus on U.S. space systems in low
Earth orbits and their unique vulnerabilities, among which is their susceptibility to
nuclear detonations at high altitudes—the same events that produce EMP. It is also
important to include, for the protection of a satellite-based system in any orbit, its control
system and ground infrastructure, including up-link and down-link facilities.
Commercial satellites support many significant services for the Federal Government,
including communications, remote sensing, weather forecasting, and imaging. The
national security and homeland security communities use commercial satellites for critical
activities, including direct and backup communications, emergency response services,
and continuity of operations during emergencies. Satellite services are important for
national security and emergency preparedness telecommunications because of their ubiquity
and separation from other communications infrastructures.
The Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and
Organization conducted an assessment of space activities that support U.S. national security
interests and concluded that space systems are vulnerable to a range of attacks due to
their political and economic value.1 Satellites in low Earth orbit generally are at risk of
lifetime degradation or failure from collateral radiation effects arising from an EMP
attack on ground targets.
In the course of an EMP attack, a nuclear detonation at a high altitude produces
numerous other effects that can impact the performance and survival of satellites.
Examination of these effects relates to the Commission’s mandate in two ways. First,
nuclear weapon effects on satellites can be collateral consequences of an EMP attack.
Second, an EMP attack can degrade ground terminals that satellite systems require for
uplinks, downlinks, and control functions.
This chapter focuses on two classes of effects that are primary threats to the physical
integrity of satellites: (1) direct, line-of-sight exposure to nuclear radiation pulses (e.g.,
X-ray, ultraviolet, gamma-ray, and neutron pulses) and (2) chronic exposure to enhanced
high-energy electrons durably trapped in the Earth’s magnetic field. These effects can
jeopardize satellites in orbit, as data from U.S. and Soviet high-altitude nuclear tests of
1958 and 1962 attest. Figure 10-1 illustrates visible phenomena from several U.S. highaltitude
nuclear tests. Each detonation produced copious X-ray fluxes and trapped energetic
electron radiation in space. When the United States detonated the 1.4-megaton (MT)
STARFISH2 device on July 9, 1962, at 400 km altitude, a total of 21 satellites were in
orbit or were launched in weeks following. Eight suffered radiation damage that compromised
or terminated their missions.3 Information concerning the fate of the remaining
13 satellites is not publicly available.

2 The high-altitude test originally known as STARFISH was not successful. A second high-altitude test called
STARFISH PRIME was successfully executed at a later date to obtain the sought-after data. In much of the
literature describing the damage to satellites from this test, the name of the event is called STARFISH without the
PRIME modifier. For the sake of brevity we also have dropped the modifier.

In many respects, satellite electronics of the 1960s were relatively robust against
nuclear effects. Their bulk and comparatively low-speed operation tended to make electronics
of the era substantially less vulnerable to radiation upset and damage than modern
electronics at comparable exposure levels. The discussion to follow highlights salient
points of satellite vulnerabilities to nuclear explosions in the upper atmosphere or space.
These vulnerabilities are considerable and incontrovertible — each worldwide fleet of
satellites is at risk, but the degree of risk depends on the extent of satellite hardening,
satellite location relative to the burst, resultant line-of-sight exposure to prompt radiations,
and each satellite’s exposure to geomagnetically trapped energetic particles of natural
and nuclear origins.

Burst conditions for each were unique, and each produced strikingly different phenomena and different enhancements
of the radiation belts.
Terms of Reference for Satellites
Ubiquitous Earth-orbiting satellites are a mainstay of modern critical national infrastructures.
Satellites provide Earth observations, communications, navigation, weather
information, and other capabilities. The United States experienced significant disruption
when the pager functions of PanAmSat Galaxy IV failed in May 1998.
Each satellite’s orbit is optimized for its intended mission. Low Earth orbits (LEO),
from 200 to 2,000 km altitude, are in proximity to the Earth and atmosphere to enable
remote sensing, weather data collection, telephony,
and other functions. Geosynchronous
(a.k.a. geostationary) orbits (GEO) lie at about
36,000 km altitude in the equatorial plane,
where their 24-hour orbital period matches the
rotation of the Earth. This orbit allows GEO
satellites to hover above a fixed longitude,
useful for communications and monitoring of
large-scale weather patterns. Satellites in highly
elliptical orbits (HEO) perform specialized
functions inaccessible to other orbits. For
example, HEO satellites in high inclination
orbits provide wide-area communications above
high-latitude regions for several hours at a time.
Figure 10-2 illustrates common orbits.
Line-of-Sight Exposure to a Nuclear
Detonation
A nuclear device will, upon detonation, radiate a portion of its total yield as X-rays,
with the fraction realized a function of weapon design and attached delivery system.

Attenuation of X-rays propagating through the upper atmosphere is primarily by photoelectric
absorption by oxygen and nitrogen and therefore is a function of X-ray spectrum,
with higher-energy photons penetrating greater path-integrated mass density along the
line of sight. Consequently, for a detonation above a (spectrally dependent) threshold
altitude, X-rays emitted horizontally or upward will propagate to large distances virtually
unattenuated by the atmosphere. X-rays emitted downward will be absorbed over ranges
of tens of kilometers upon reaching sufficiently dense air.
Neutrons and gamma rays emitted by a detonation similarly propagate upward great
distances into space for detonations above threshold altitudes. However, owing to scattering
and absorption cross sections substantially smaller than X-ray photoelectric cross
sections, major atmospheric attenuation of these energetic emissions occurs at altitudes
below approximately 40 km.
For detonations up to a few hundred kilometers
altitude, blast wave interactions between
expanding weapon debris and the atmosphere
may convert a majority of the kinetic yield of the
weapon to ultraviolet (UV) photons. These
photons propagate upward into space with little
attenuation. UV photons emitted horizontally and
downward are absorbed in the vicinity of the burst
point to form the UV fireball. UV production for
bursts above a few hundred kilometers declines
rapidly, with precise values for these transition
altitudes being functions of weapon output
characteristics and dynamics. The combined flux
of energetic photons (X-ray, gamma, and UV) and
neutrons irradiates a vast region of space,
diminished by spherical divergence, as shown in
figure 10-3. The actual size of the hazard zone
depends on weapon yield, detonation altitude, and
the degree of satellite hardening against disruption
or harm. Damage to satellite structures and to coatings on solar panels and sensor optics
occurs when X-ray and UV fluxes exceed critical thresholds. Electronics damage similarly
ensues when X-ray and gamma pulses induce destructive electric currents in circuit
elements and when energetic neutrons penetrate solid-state circuitry.

Persistently Trapped Radiation and Its Effects
In 1957, N. Christofilos at the University of California Lawrence Radiation Laboratory
postulated that the Earth’s magnetic field could act as a container to trap energetic electrons
liberated by a high-altitude nuclear explosion to form a radiation belt that would encircle
the Earth.4 In 1958, J. Van Allen and colleagues at the State University of Iowa used data
from the Explorer I and III satellites to discover the Earth’s natural radiation belts.5 Figure
10-4 provides an idealized view of the Van Allen belts. Later in 1958, the United States
conducted three low-yield ARGUS high-altitude nuclear tests, producing nuclear radiation
belts detected by the Explorer IV satellite and other probes. In 1962, larger tests by the
United States and the Soviet Union produced
more pronounced and longer lasting radiation
belts that caused deleterious effects to satellites
then in orbit or launched soon thereafter.
A nuclear detonation is a significant source of
free electrons originating from the highly ionized
plasma that is a product of the nuclear blast.
Nuclear detonations also create trapped radiation
by beta decay of radioactive weapon debris and
free-space decay of neutrons from the explosion,
thereby creating electrons with energies up to
several million electron volts (MeV). The most
notable tests producing radiation hazards to
satellites were the U.S. STARFISH detonation
and three high-altitude tests by the Soviets, all
conducted in 1962.
One assesses natural and trapped nuclear radiation effects on contemporary satellites by
calculating repeated passage of a satellite through radiation belts over the satellite’s lifetime.
While the geometry of a satellite’s orbit is relatively straightforward, characterization
of spatial and temporal properties of both natural and nuclear radiation belts is a
complex problem. Nevertheless, one can
establish relative scaling of levels of vulnerability
from radiation belt geometry, as shown in
figure 10-5. Intensities of radiation belts depend
strongly on burst latitude. A burst at low latitude
fills a small magnetic flux tube volume, so
trapped flux tends to be concentrated and
intense. The same burst at higher latitude fills a
much larger magnetic flux tube volume.
All quantitative assessments of effects on satellite
lifetime provided in this chapter are based
on calculations carried out using a code that

Nuclear Weapon Effects on Electronic Systems
Electronic systems perform many critical spacecraft functions. An electronic power
control system regulates the energy obtained from the solar cells. Attitude control circuits
keep the vehicle oriented so that solar panels receive maximum exposure to the sun and
sensors face the Earth. Information collected by sensors must be processed, stored, and
transmitted to the Earth on demand. Communications satellites receive information, possibly
process it, and then retransmit it, all by electronic circuits. Both prompt and longterm
radiation effects have the potential for corrupting these functions in systems that
lack hardening or other mitigation of nuclear effects.
Total-Dose Damage
A common criterion for failure of an electronic part is the total radiation energy per unit
volume deposited in silicon. This absorbed energy density is expressed in rads(Si) (1 rad =
100 ergs/gram). Natural radiation to an electronic part in the International Space Station
(ISS) behind a 2.54 mm semi-infinite (very large) aluminum slab averages about 100 rads
per year. Previous literature has commonly used this shielding thickness for satellite radiation
exposure calculations. However, it should be noted that electronics are placed in a
variety of locations in a satellite and, therefore, can have different levels of shielding. Natural
radiation to an electronic part in LEO, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) satellite, in polar orbit behind a 2.54 mm semi-infinite aluminum
slab is, on long-term average, about 620 rads per year, while some satellites with the same
shielding might receive 50 kilorads per year.6 Electronics must be shielded in accordance
with the intended orbit to limit the dose received to a tolerable level.
Radiation-Induced Electrostatic Discharge
One hazard to spacecraft passing through the natural or nuclear radiation belts is internal
or “deep dielectric” charging.7 Lower-energy electrons (40 to 300 keV) become
embedded in surface materials or poorly shielded internal materials and, on a timescale of
hours to days, can build up sufficient electric field to cause a discharge, often resulting in
satellite upset and occasionally in serious damage. Thermal blankets, external cables, and
poorly shielded circuit boards are prime candidates for this type of charging. Modern
coverglasses and optical solar reflectors are made sufficiently conductive to avoid such
local charge buildup.
Radiation Effects Assessment and Hardening
Susceptibility of electronic components to nuclear weapon radiation has been studied
intensively both experimentally and analytically since 1956. State-of-the-art computers
and algorithms are used to extrapolate the experimental results to an operational
environment.
The EMP Commission’s mission was to evaluate the threat of high altitude nuclear
weapon-induced EMP on American national infrastructure. A collateral result of a high
altitude burst is a radiation threat to satellites, primarily those residing in LEO. The damage
manifests as upset or burnout of sensitive microelectronics on the spacecraft. In some

cases, damage can occur to external surfaces and structural members, as well as to optical
components and to solar-cell power sources.
To address these issues, we considered a plausible set of 21 EMP nuclear events, which
are listed in table 10-1. These disparate threats were then imposed upon a set of satellites
(table 10-2) representative of the U.S. space infrastructure to examine the ancillary
effects of an exoatmospheric nuclear detonation.
The time frame of interest is through the year 2015. As indicated in table 10-1, cases
include both higher and lower yield weapons. Though not included in tables 10-1

While the primary threat from nuclear-pumped radiation belts is to satellites in
relatively low orbits, high-yield bursts could be detonated at latitudes and longitudes that
would threaten higher orbiting satellites (Events 18 to 21). These bursts would be at
relatively high latitudes sufficient to allow high-energy electrons to migrate along
geomagnetic field lines that reach the high altitudes at which geosynchronous satellites
reside.9 Of course, at higher orbital altitudes, the density of ionizing radiation would be
much reduced over that experienced by a satellite orbiting at lower altitudes and
8 It is conventional (and useful) to describe the magnetic field lines on which electrons are trapped as belonging to
numbered L-shells. The L-value of a field line is the distance (in Earth radii measured from the location of Earth’s
dipole field source) at which the field line intersects the magnetic equator. The inner belt peaks around L = 1.3, and
the outer belt, near L = 4. Trapped electrons rapidly gyrate about the field lines, bounce along the field lines between
mirror points, and drift around the Earth.
9 As illustrated in figure 10-5, magnetic field lines that intersect the Earth at high northern and southern latitudes
extend outward into space to relatively large distances. Conversely, magnetic field lines that intersect the Earth at
low latitudes extend relatively short distances into space. Consequently, geomagnetically trapped electrons created
by detonations at high latitudes can propagate along field lines out to very high altitudes where satellites orbit,
whereas trapped electrons created by low-latitude bursts would be less likely to do so.

It is emphasized that these events were chosen only for purposes of effects analysis.
The satellites (table 10-2) were chosen to be representative of the many types and missions
in orbit and to be representative targets for the radiation effects.
Prompt Radiation Effects
When a weapon is detonated at high altitude, satellites that lie within line of sight of the
burst will be subject to direct (X-ray) radiation. Satellites in the shadow cast by the Earth
will not be directly irradiated, as illustrated in figure 10-3, but will be subject to electron
radiation as they transit debris and decay-products (primarily energetic beta electrons)
mentioned previously that are trapped in the Earth’s magnetic field. If there is a significant
mass of intervening atmosphere between the detonation point and the satellite, direct
nuclear radiation will be attenuated. Lacking this intervening shield, the radiation fluence
will decrease as the inverse square of the distance.
Worst-case situations occur when a satellite is nearest the burst; for example, directly
above or below it. In such cases, the range between satellite and burst is minimized, and
X-ray, gamma, and neutron fluences on the satellite are maximized. Full evaluation of
this hazard requires statistical analysis. The likelihood that the satellite will be in direct
line of sight of the burst is typically 5 to 20 percent, depending on orbital parameters for
the satellite and burst location. Even then, damage may be ameliorated by either distance
or intervening atmosphere.
Calculations of X-ray exposure probabilities were performed for Events 9, 13, 17, and
18. The calculations yield the probability that a specific satellite will be exposed to a
specified level of X-ray fluence. Results appear in table 10-3. With this information, one
can estimate the probability of satellite damage based on known damage thresholds for
spacecraft materials. Thresholds for various types of damage were chosen at, or close to,
values accepted by the engineering community. Here, thermomechanical damage refers
to removal or degradation of the coatings on solar cell surfaces. Depending on nuclear
weapon output spectra, coating damage is generally a satellite’s most sensitive thermomechanical
damage mode. SGEMP (System-Generated EMP) burnout is damage
caused by currents associated with X-ray-induced electron emission. Latch-up is a logic
state setting of a semiconductor device that becomes frozen as a result of radiation exposure.
Latch-up may cause large currents to flow in the affected circuit, resulting in unacceptable
current-induced damage (i.e., burnout).
Line-of-sight exposure of the ISS to photons can cause significant damage to the solararray
coverglass coatings for Events 6, 7, 8, 9, and 17. NOAA/DMSP and TERRA/
IKONOS are unlikely to be promptly affected thermomechanically by a line-of-sight

photon exposure in any of our postulated nuclear events. Satellites in GEO are sufficiently
far away because of their higher altitudes that the inverse square fall-off of the
radiation reduces the potential exposure to a tolerable level.

Reduction in satellite lifetime is based on total dose from higher energy electrons to
internal electronics, assumed to be shielded by a 0.100-inch slab of aluminum. In evaluating
the biological response of astronauts to radiation on the ISS, 0.220 inches of slab
shielding was assumed because the astronauts would usually be inside the pressurized
modules of the space station. Some critical electronics for the station were still assumed
to be shielded by only 100 mils of aluminum. Satellites are assumed to be hardened to
twice the long-term-average natural background radiation encountered during a nominal
mission.10 Just as with photons, damage to spacecraft thermal, optical, and other surface
coatings is caused by exposure to electrons of relatively low energies.
Except for the ISS in Event 4, even the low-yield events are capable of imposing a
much-reduced lifetime on the satellites.
In the set of events depicted in table 10-5, the large weapon used in Event 17 inflicts
severe damage on the ISS. Significantly, this exposure would cause radiation sickness to
the astronauts within approximately 1 hour and a 90 percent probability of death within 2
to 3 hours.
10 While the use of twice the expected long-term-average exposure as a gauge of lifetime, as discussed here, is common
practice, it relies entirely on total dose as a measure of radiation tolerance and ignores dose rate effects. Risks from
circumstances involving nuclear detonations, where dose rates could be much larger than encountered under natural
conditions, may be underestimated.

The results of weapons detonated at high latitudes (Events 18 through 21) produced no
dramatic nuclear effects. This is largely because these satellites are designed to operate in
a far more hostile natural space environment due to the solar wind than are those in LEO.
Generally, most papers dealing with satellite lifetimes following a high-altitude nuclear
detonation treat radiation effects on newly launched satellites with no pre-burst accumulated
total dose. Except for satellites launched as replacements after a detonation, a more
realistic assessment would assume a high-altitude detonation after a satellite had been in
orbit for a portion of its anticipated service life. If a satellite is near the end of its design
lifetime (i.e., has accumulated the majority of the total dose it can tolerate) prior to the
detonation, the dose absorbed from a nuclear-pumped belt could cause prompt demise.
To evaluate potential life-shortening effects on satellites, we examined a constellation of
generic satellite systems. To assess sensitivity to assumed hardening level, we evaluated
two hypothetical constellations. One constellation was assumed hardened to 1.5 times the
natural total dose anticipated over the design lifetime (1.5x). The other constellation was
assumed hardened to 2x. The scenario involved a 10 MT burst (50 percent fission yield)
detonated on May 23, 2003, at an altitude of 90 km over northern Lake Superior (48.5
degrees north latitude, 87 degrees west longitude). Total dose for each constellation was
based on realistic code calculations.
Figure 10-6 shows the resulting number of satellites remaining as a function of time
after the burst. The blue and red curves correspond to the constellations hardened to 1.5x
and 2x, respectively. Corresponding outage times for ground-based receivers are shown
in Figure 10-7. Clearly, decreasing satellite hardening by 25 percent has a marked effect
on survivability in this case.

HEO satellites already reside in orbits that are relatively challenging in terms of the
natural radiation environment. Assuming these satellites are hardened to twice the natural
dose they would normally accumulate in 15 years, a satellite’s electronics would be hardened
to approximately 325 krad behind a 100 mil (0.1 inch) semi-infinite slab of aluminum.
With this level of hardness, one would expect that these satellites would not be vulnerable
to a high-altitude burst of a single, low-yield (approximately 50 kT) device of
unsophisticated design. Realistic code calculations suggest this is indeed the case.
Three large-yield events were investigated to determine whether they would present a
threat to HEO satellites. Two of these events (Events 11 and 21) would not present a total
ionizing dose problem for the satellite. Although Event 21 is a 10-MT burst, it has little
effect on a HEO satellite because the trapped electrons are spread out over a large L-shell
region. In contrast, the 100 kT of Event 11 does result in some detectable radiation accumulation
on the satellite as it passes through altitudes near perigee. The yield is, however,
too low to present a threat to the satellite. A 5-MT burst depicted in Event 17, on the
other hand, does present a substantial threat to HEO satellites, given the hardening
assumptions mentioned earlier. Figure 10-8 shows that the assumed 2x natural hardening
level of the satellite is exceeded about 36 days after Event 17.
Analysis of direct EMP attacks over the northern continental United States (CONUS)
or Canada indicates lesser risk to LEO satellites from weapons with yields ranging from
10 kT to 100 kT. For yields approaching 1 MT (or greater) detonated at such latitudes, it
becomes more difficult to predict the fate of LEO satellites. The larger yields make more
severe nuclear-enhanced trapped flux environments, but depletion rates of trapped fluxes
(both natural and nuclear) are difficult to predict.
Satellite Ground Stations
Although bursts over CONUS may not directly damage satellites, the EMP effect on
ground control stations could still render some satellites inoperable. We have focused our
analyses on collateral weapon effects on satellites, without discussion of EMP effects on
ground stations used for uplinks, downlinks, and satellite control. Currently, many of the
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES

168

important satellite systems use unique transmission protocols with dedicated ground
terminals. Unique protocols limit interoperability, so loss of dedicated ground terminals
could readily compromise overall functionality of a system, even if the system’s satellites
remained undamaged.
While satellites generally are designed to operate autonomously, with periodic housekeeping
status downloads to ground controllers and uploads of commands, once damaged,
satellites may require frequent, perhaps continuous, control from the ground to
remain even partially functional. Thus, loss of ground stations to EMP could render otherwise
functional satellites ineffective or lead to premature loss.
A comprehensive analysis of overall satellite system degradation should include potential
loss of ground stations and cost/benefit trade-offs with respect to EMP hardening. A
scenario-based analysis would reveal the extent to which loss of individual ground stations
may pose an additional level of vulnerability.
Discussion of Results
Given inherent satellite fragility owing to severe weight constraints, any nation with
missile lift capability and sufficient technology in the requisite disciplines can directly
attack and destroy a satellite. Such attacks are outside the focus of this study. The Commission
considered only hazards to satellites that may arise as collateral nuclear weapon
effects during an EMP attack. The prominent collateral hazards are prompt nuclear output
(X-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons), high fluences of UV photons generated by some
high-altitude nuclear detonations, and nuclear burst enhancement (pumping) of the radiation
belts surrounding the Earth in the region of space where satellites orbit.
The worst-case exposure of a satellite to direct x-radiation from a nuclear weapon can
be lethal. For LEO satellites, the threat can be nonnegligible, but for satellites at GEO,
the large distance between a detonation designed for an EMP attack and a satellite makes
the probability of direct damage very low. The same argument holds for exposure to
gamma rays, neutrons, and burst-generated UV light.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 10. Space Systems
169
Nuclear-enhanced radiation belts must be considered differently, owing to their persistence
and wide spatial distribution around the Earth. Because the natural trapped radiation
environment at GEO is more severe on average than at most LEO locations, satellites
at GEO typically are hardened to a greater extent than LEO satellites. Absent large yields
(megatons), burst-generated energetic electron fluxes trapped in high-latitude (i.e., high
L-shell) magnetic flux tubes generally are not sufficiently intense and long-lasting to
cause the early demise of satellites in GEO, unless those satellites have accumulated
sufficient natural radiation exposure to put them near the end of their service lives.11
Satellites in LEO are much more susceptible to damage from both direct and persistent
radiation that results from an EMP attack, but the possibility of damage is highly dependent
on weapon parameters (latitude and longitude, height of burst [HOB], and weapon
yield).
Line-of-sight exposure of LEO research satellites such as ISS to X-ray and UV photons
can cause significant damage to solar-array coverglass coatings for Events 6, 8, 9, 17, and
19. While such exposures are statistically infrequent, in those instances where they occur,
they will result in immediate loss of many operational capabilities, as well as loss of
power generating capacity.
The low-energy component of trapped-electron flux from beta decay of fission products
and decay of free neutrons exceeds the long-term average natural flux for the high-yield
Events 8, 9, and 17. Such flux levels will cause electrostatic breakdown in certain types
of thermal radiator coatings and external cables on NOAA and TERRA within the first
few days following the burst.
Uncertainties in Estimates
Uncertainties in satellite vulnerabilities result from imprecise knowledge of threat environments,
combined with uncertainties in responses of satellite materials to those environments.
Difficulties in characterizing aging effects of materials exposed to on-orbit
conditions for extended periods exacerbate these uncertainties.
In the following comments, it is assumed that the weapons in question mirror U.S.
technology available in the time frame 1970 to 1980.
Uncertainties in direct line-of-sight exposure of a satellite to radiation from a nuclear
detonation result primarily from unknowns associated with the design of an offensive
weapon, its delivery system, and its detonation altitude. These factors determine the fraction
of weapon yield emitted as photons, neutrons, and beta particles and, hence, the type
and magnitude of damage they inflict on satellites. Variability of weapon designs is estimated
to lead to an uncertainty of approximately plus or minus a factor of five in UV
hazard source strength (radiation primarily emitted from a weapon’s case and its packaging
within a delivery vehicle [but see below for more on UV photons]). Based on computational
correlations with experimental data, there exits at least a factor of 10 uncertainty
in X-ray spectral intensity at arbitrary photon energies of a kilovolt or more.
Uncertainties in gamma-ray fluence and flux predictions are thought to be on the order of
±15 percent, as are those for prompt neutrons. Total yield is believed to be accurate to
±10 percent.
11 The reader is reminded that our analysis deals only with collateral damage resulting from an EMP attack. Direct
attack on satellites at any altitude, though serious, is not within the bounds of this analysis.
CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES
Chapter 10. Space Systems
170
For bursts below a few hundred kilometers altitude, the debris-air blast-wave-generated
fluence of UV photons (which can be as large as 80 percent of the kinetic yield of the
device) carries an estimated uncertainty factor of 3 to 10, depending primarily on device
characteristics. These uncertainty factors are ameliorated to some degree by decreasing
burst altitude. Detonations below approximately 90 km occur in sufficiently dense air that
UV photons are largely absorbed before they can escape to space.
Uncertainties in trapped radiation environments from high-altitude nuclear detonations
also result from unknowns in offensive weapon design, but additional uncertainties arise
in dispersal of radioactive weapon debris, efficiency with which beta particles become
trapped in the geomagnetic field, subsequent transport of trapped particles, and the rapidity
with which nuclear-burst enhancements of the radiation belts decay into the natural
background. Under the best of circumstances, uncertainties in the intensity and persistence
of trapped radiation estimated for the events considered in this report are at least a
factor of 10 and are likely substantially more in situations that depart from limited circumstances
of past nuclear tests.
Findings
Potential Vulnerabilities
An EMP attack on any of several important geographic regions could cause serious
damage to LEO satellites. The STARFISH high-altitude nuclear burst greatly enhanced
the high-energy electron environment in LEO, resulting in the early demise of several
satellites on orbit at the time.12 Copious documentation exists that describes recent radiation-
induced satellite failures due to the natural radiation environment alone.
Given the large uncertainties discussed above, there may be a temptation to ignore the
issue of high-altitude nuclear threats to satellites for the time being simply because
insufficient information is available to implement a cost-effective protection solution. We
believe that ignoring the issue would be ill advised for a number of reasons, including the
consequences of losing possibly tens of billions of dollars in LEO space assets in a short
time.
Mitigation of Threats
Any adversary possessing a lift and orbiting control capability can destroy a satellite: it
is clearly neither cost effective nor desirable to harden every satellite against every possible
threat. The challenge is to weigh risks/rewards of mitigation against mission priorities
and plausible threats. A number of threat mitigation measures exist or have been proposed
as an alternative or supplement to hardening.
Any combination of hardening and mitigation options can be chosen to achieve the
required degree of survivability. Alternatives must be explored, documented, and
reviewed so that management and users of space assets can make rational appraisals of
the costs, benefits, and consequences of space system degradation and/or loss.
Hardening of Satellites and Ground Stations
Commercial satellites are hardened against their natural orbital environment to achieve
the lifetime necessary to realize a profit. The technology to accomplish this goal is built
into their design and factored into their cost. Protection from nuclear threats is not

provided to commercial satellites because, from the commercial operator’s perspective, it
is not cost effective to do so.
The cost of hardening a system has been a subject of continuing controversy for the
past 45 years. Systems project offices tend to estimate high to avoid the introduction of
measures that threaten to escalate system cost. Achievable cost control is contingent upon
ab initio design of radiation hardness into the system rather than on retrofitting it. Options
other than hardening and shielding include repositioning selected satellites in times of
stress to minimize exposure to enhanced radiation belts.
If the ground stations for satellites in any orbit are not hardened to EMP, the utility of
the satellites could degrade, depending on their ability to operate autonomously.
Recommendations
􀂋 Each Federal Government organization that acquires and/or uses space should execute
a systematic assessment of the significance of each such space system, particularly
those in low Earth orbits, to its missions. Information from this assessment and associated
cost and risk judgments will inform senior government decision-making regarding
protection and performance assurance of these systems, so that each mission can
be executed with the required degree of surety in the face of possible threats.

Chapter 11. Government
Introduction
A primary role of the Federal Government is to defend the Nation against threats to its
security. EMP represents one such threat. Indeed, it is one of a small number of threats
that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences. The Executive branch of
the Federal Government bears the responsibility for executing a strategy for dealing with
this threat. The Commission has recommended a strategy for addressing this threat that
combines prevention, protection, and recovery. It represents what we believe to be the
best approach for addressing the EMP threat.
The Commission has identified an array of recommendations relating to civilian infrastructures
that are logical outgrowths of our recommended strategy. Those recommendations
relating to civilian infrastructures are contained in the individual chapters of
this volume and will not be repeated here. Implementation of these recommendations will
result in the identification of responsibilities at the regional, state, and local levels.
The Federal Government not only has the responsibility for being appropriately
postured to cope with all aspects of the EMP threat, including preparations for recovery,
but also has the responsibility to be able to respond to and manage national recovery in a
competent and effective manner in the wake of an EMP attack. American citizens expect
such competence and effectiveness from responsible government officials at all levels. In
order to properly manage response and recovery, essential government functions will
have to survive and function in the wake of an EMP attack.
Maintaining Government Connectivity and Coherence
It is essential that the Government continues to function through an electromagnetic
pulse (EMP) emergency. Events over the last few years have highlighted the need for
assured and real-time communications connectivity between government leadership and
organizational assets for both crisis management and the management of a controlled
recovery. Plans to ensure the continued functioning of government are embodied in Continuity
of Operations (COOP) plans prepared by government organizations in anticipation
of emergency situations and Continuity of Government (COG) planning to ensure the
survival of constitutional government. National Security Presidential Directive 51 (NSPD
51) and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20 (HSPD 20 on the subject of
“National Continuity Policy”, as described in a White House summary released May 9,
20071), outlines these issues and directs the implementation of COOP and COG (excerpts
noted below). The EMP Commission met with National Security Council staff to discuss
COG-related issues as they might relate to EMP threats. However, COG planning
remains highly classified, and only this top-level overview can be provided within this
venue.
Recommendations
􀂋 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should give priority to measures that
ensure the President and other senior Federal officials can exercise informed leadership
of the Nation in the aftermath of an EMP attack and that improve post-attack
response capabilities at all levels of government.

􀂋 The President, Secretary of Homeland Security, and other senior officials must be able
to manage national recovery in an informed and reliable manner. Current national
capabilities were developed for Cold War scenarios in which it was imperative that the
President have assured connectivity to strategic retaliatory forces. While this requirement
is still important, there is a new need for considerably broader and robust connectivity
between national leaders, government at all levels, and key organizations
within each infrastructure sector so that the status of infrastructures can be assessed in
a reliable and comprehensive manner and their recovery and reconstitution can be
managed intelligently. The DHS, working through the Homeland Security Council,
should give high priority to identifying and achieving the minimum level of robust
connectivity needed for recovery following an EMP attack. In doing so, DHS should
give particular emphasis to exercises that evaluate the robustness of the solutions
being implemented.
􀂋 Working with state authorities and private sector organizations, the DHS should
develop draft protocols for implementation by emergency and other government
responses following an EMP attack, Red Team these extensively, and then
institutionalize validated protocols through issuance of standards, training, and
exercises.

Subject: “National Continuity Policy”
9 May 2007
Purpose
(1) This directive establishes a comprehensive national policy on the continuity of Federal Government
structures and operations and a single National Continuity Coordinator responsible for coordinating the
development and implementation of Federal continuity policies. This policy establishes "National
Essential Functions," prescribes continuity requirements for all executive departments and agencies,
and provides guidance for State, local, territorial, and tribal governments, and private sector
organizations in order to ensure a comprehensive and integrated national continuity program that will
enhance the credibility of our national security posture and enable a more rapid and effective response
to and recovery from a national emergency.
Definitions
(2) In this directive:
(a) "Category" refers to the categories of executive departments and agencies listed in Annex A to this
directive;
(b) "Catastrophic Emergency" means any incident, regardless of location, that results in extraordinary
levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population, infrastructure,
environment, economy, or government functions;
(c) "Continuity of Government," or "COG," means a coordinated effort within the Federal Government's
executive branch to ensure that National Essential Functions continue to be performed during a
Catastrophic Emergency;
(d) "Continuity of Operations," or "COOP," means an effort within individual executive departments and
agencies to ensure that Primary Mission-Essential Functions continue to be performed during a wide
range of emergencies, including localized acts of nature, accidents, and technological or attack-related
emergencies;
(e) "Enduring Constitutional Government," or "ECG," means a cooperative effort among the executive,
legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government, coordinated by the President, as a matter
of comity with respect to the legislative and judicial branches and with proper respect for the
constitutional separation of powers among the branches, to preserve the constitutional framework under
which the Nation is governed and the capability of all three branches of government to execute
constitutional responsibilities and provide for orderly succession, appropriate transition of leadership,
and interoperability and support of the National Essential Functions during a catastrophic emergency;

Implementation Actions
(4) Continuity requirements shall be incorporated into daily operations of all executive departments and
agencies. As a result of the asymmetric threat environment, adequate warning of potential emergencies
that could pose a significant risk to the homeland might not be available, and therefore all continuity
planning shall be based on the assumption that no such warning will be received. Emphasis will be
placed upon geographic dispersion of leadership, staff, and infrastructure in order to increase
survivability and maintain uninterrupted Government Functions. Risk management principles shall be
applied to ensure that appropriate operational readiness decisions are based on the probability of an
attack or other incident and its consequences.
…
(10) Federal Government COOP, COG, and ECG plans and operations shall be appropriately integrated
with the emergency plans and capabilities of State, local, territorial, and tribal governments, and private
sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure, as appropriate, in order to promote interoperability
and to prevent redundancies and conflicting lines of authority. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall
coordinate the integration of Federal continuity plans and operations with State, local, territorial, and
tribal governments, and private sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure, as appropriate, in
order to provide for the delivery of essential services during an emergency.
(11) Continuity requirements for the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and executive departments
and agencies shall include the following:
(a) The continuation of the performance of PMEFs during any emergency must be for a period up to 30
days or until normal operations can be resumed, and the capability to be fully operational at alternate
sites as soon as possible after the occurrence of an emergency, but not later than 12 hours after COOP
activation;
(b) Succession orders and pre-planned devolution of authorities that ensure the emergency delegation of
authority must be planned and documented in advance in accordance with applicable law;
(c) Vital resources, facilities, and records must be safeguarded, and official access to them must be
provided;
(d) Provision must be made for the acquisition of the resources necessary for continuity operations on an
emergency basis;
(e) Provision must be made for the availability and redundancy of critical communications capabilities at
alternate sites in order to support connectivity between and among key government leadership, internal
elements, other executive departments and agencies, critical partners, and the public;
(f) Provision must be made for reconstitution capabilities that allow for recovery from a catastrophic
emergency and resumption of normal operations; and
(g) Provision must be made for the identification, training, and preparedness of personnel capable of
relocating to alternate facilities to support the continuation of the performance of PMEFs.
…
(19) Heads of executive departments and agencies shall execute their respective department or agency
COOP plans in response to a localized emergency and shall:
(a) Appoint a senior accountable official, at the Assistant Secretary level, as the Continuity Coordinator

Chapter 12. Keeping The Citizenry Informed: Effects On People
Introduction
The best current estimate is that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) produced by a highaltitude
nuclear detonation is not likely to have direct adverse effects on people. Such
effects have not been observed for the personnel who operate EMP simulators.1 Medical
surveillance studies on human exposure to pulsed electromagnetic fields have supported
this inference. 2
An important exception is people whose well-being depends on electronic life support
equipment. They will be directly impacted by effects that disrupt or damage such devices.
Research sponsored by the Commission suggests that some heart pacemakers may be
among the devices susceptible to upset from high-altitude EMP.3,4
While most effects on people would be indirect, they could be significant in a just-intime
economy in which local stocks of medicines, baby food, and other health-critical
items are limited. The physical consequences of the serious high-altitude EMP attacks on
the United States (U.S.) of concern to the Commission would likely include the failure of
the electric power grid and degradation of telecommunication systems, computers, and
electronic components over large areas of the country. A disruption of this scale could
cripple critical infrastructures and hinder the delivery of day-to-day necessities, because
of the interconnectivity of telecommunication networks and the electrical dependence of
most cities, government agencies, businesses, households, and individuals. It also could
require a long recovery period. To assess human consequences, the contingency of concern
is one in which electricity, telecommunications, and electronics are out of service
over a significant area for an extended period of time.
The human consequences of such a scenario include the social and psychological reactions
to a sudden loss of stability in the modern infrastructure over a large area of the
country. Loss of connectivity between the government and its populace would only exacerbate
the consequences of such a scenario.
This analysis is based largely on selected case studies, including major blackouts, natural
disasters, and terrorist incidents in recent U.S. history. These incidents served as
approximate analogs in order to best predict the sociological and psychological effects of
an EMP attack.
Impact of an EMP Attack
While no single event serves as a model for an EMP scenario with incidence of longlasting
widespread power outage, communications failure, and other effects, the combined
analysis of the following case studies provides useful insight in determining human
reactions following an EMP attack:

Blackouts
In 1965, a blackout occurred over the northeastern United States and parts of Canada.
New Hampshire; Vermont; Massachusetts; Connecticut; Rhode Island; New York,
including metropolitan New York City; and a small part of Pennsylvania were in the dark
after operators at Consolidated Edison were forced to shut down its generators to avoid
damage. Street traffic was chaotic, and some people were trapped in elevators, but there
were few instances of antisocial behavior while the lights were out.5 It was a “long night
in the dark,” but the recovery proceeded without incident, and citizens experienced relative
civility.
TIME Magazine described New York’s next blackout, in 1977, as a “Night of Terror.” 6
Widespread chaos reigned in the city until power was restored — entire blocks were
looted and set ablaze, people flipped over cars and vans on the streets; the city was in
pandemonium. That night 3,776 arrests were made, and certainly not all looters, thieves,
and arsonists were apprehended or arrested.7 While this is a dramatic example of antisocial
behavior following a blackout, sociologists point to extraordinary demographic and
historical issues that contributed to the looting. For instance, extreme poverty and socioeconomic
inequality plagued New York neighborhoods, and many of the looters originated
from the poorer sections of the city, engaging in “vigilante redistribution” by looting
consumer goods and luxuries. Racial tensions were high, and a serial killer known as
Son of Sam had recently terrorized New Yorkers.
In 1989, more than 6 million customers lost power when the geomagnetic storm discussed
in Chapter 4 caused a massive power failure in Quebec. The electricity failures
caused by this geomagnetic storm reached a much larger area than is typically affected by
traditional blackouts resulting from technological failure. However, the outage lasted just
over 9 hours, most of which were during the day.8 The local and national papers were
curiously silent about the blackout, and little to no unusual or adverse human behavior
was attributed to the power loss. The event was most significantly a lesson for operators
of the North American electric grids because it revealed vulnerabilities in the system.

In 1998, Auckland, New Zealand, experienced a significant blackout that lasted more
than 5 weeks and affected more than 1 million people.9 Civility reigned for the duration
of the outage, which was likely attributed to a number of factors, including:
􀂋 There was no significant threat to public health, because water and sewage infrastructures
were functioning.
􀂋 In anticipation of potential incidents, police increased their presence in urban areas.
􀂋 The recovery process was underway nearly immediately, communicating to the public
that the situation would eventually be under control.
􀂋 Nearly all blackout recovery resources of New Zealand were rushed to the capital for
recovery efforts.
Recovery efforts from elsewhere in New Zealand were significant symbolically as well
as practically, as demonstrated by the fact that electricity was available elsewhere. Businesses
attempted to carry on as normally as possible, with some examples of opportunism,
such as businesses relocating to more desirable spaces that had been vacated. Social
consequences included criticism and blame of the authorities, both municipal and
national, because the technological failures were attributed in large part to privatization
of the power sector. However, this response never materialized into violence, crime, or
social disorder.
Most recently, New York City and the eight states in the northeast experienced another
significant blackout in August 2003. While the blackout inconvenienced many on a hot
summer day, general civility remained intact. News coverage indicated that those
affected by the blackout dealt with the obstacles quietly and even developed a sort of
camaraderie while struggling through nights without running water and electricity. In
contrast to the 1977 blackout, police made only 850 arrests the night of the 2003 blackout,
of which “only 250 to 300 were directly attributable to the blackout,” indicating a
slight decline from the average number of arrests on a given summer day.10 While this
blackout was widespread, it was not long lasting, and it did not interrupt the communications
infrastructure significantly.
Blackouts provide only a partial picture of life following an EMP attack. Most
blackouts are localized and are resolved quickly. Further, usually communication systems
are not completely shut down, and major infrastructures can remain intact if significant
portions of infrastructure hardware are located outside of the affected area. In order to
best approximate the effects of longer-lasting, widespread infrastructure disruption—with
or without electrical power failure—it is necessary to look to natural disasters for
examples of human reaction.
Natural Disasters
At the time that Hurricane Hugo hit in 1989, it was the most intense hurricane to strike
Georgia and the Carolinas in 100 years. Surveys of Hurricane Hugo’s survivors indicate
that some individuals who suffered personal and financial losses from the hurricane
showed clinically significant symptoms of psychological trauma. According to some
researchers, many of the adverse mental health effects of Hugo could be explained by
deterioration in perceived social support. While on the whole, the rate of post-traumatic

179
stress disorder symptoms was low, stress effects lingered long after the hurricane’s
physical damage was repaired.
Hurricane Andrew blew through the southeastern United States and along the coast of
the Gulf of Mexico in 1992, causing $26.5 billion in damage. Andrew left 250,000 families
homeless and 1.4 million families without electricity immediately following the hurricane.
After such extraordinary destruction and disruption, it is perhaps not surprising
that one-third of a sample of individuals met criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder 4
months after the hurricane.11
Hurricanes Hugo and Andrew demonstrated to psychologists that disaster-related
declines in perceived support explained the difference in symptoms between the two disasters;
deterioration was more significant in Andrew and recovery was weaker. In the
long-lasting recovery period, Floridians saw looting, opportunism, and vigilante civil
defense. Press coverage of Hurricane Andrew suggests that after a multi-state disaster,
people will expect help, and they will expect it from the federal government, as well as
from state and local authorities.
Flooding in the American Midwest in 1993 resulted in 25 deaths, affected more than 8
million acres, and cost billions of dollars in property damage and more than 2 billion
dollars in crop damage. Water depths ranged from 11 feet of flooding in Minneapolis to
43 feet in St. Louis. Electricity was restored where possible within 3 days and in downtown
Des Moines within 23 hours. The floods devastated families, businesses, and individuals,
who lost nearly everything and were unable to control events throughout the
recovery process. Thousands of people assisted in volunteer recovery efforts by sandbagging
and providing needed supplies.12 Most came from unaffected areas to help the most
urgent victims. The floods provide an example of widespread damage crippling several
infrastructures for a significant period of time and an example of a disaster in which
regional experience may matter tremendously in disaster recovery.
Blackouts and natural disasters have limits as approximations of recovery following an
EMP attack. An important element is the relevance of fear and individual panic in these
situations versus what might occur following an EMP attack. For this component, it is
useful to examine recent terrorist incidents in the United States in order to gauge the
effects of fear among the public. Because terrorist attacks appear to be indiscriminate and
random, they can arouse acute anxiety and feelings of helplessness, which shatter beliefs
of invulnerability and even a belief in justice and order in the world.
Terrorist Incidents
The attacks on the World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 2001, certainly
qualified as seemingly indiscriminate and random. Following this disaster, in which
nearly 3,000 people died, those in the immediate and surrounding area showed considerable
psychological trauma and damage. Some individuals who experienced these attacks
may have lost confidence in their abilities to cope and control outcomes. Overall, however,
the survivors of the attacks proved remarkably resilient, flexible, and competent in
the face of an arbitrary, violent, and completely unexpected attack.13

In October 2001, a month following the attack on the World Trade Center, Americans
saw a series of anthrax-infected mail pieces threatening intended mail recipients and handlers.
The death toll was small (five individuals), but public concern was considerable.
This period is an example of public response to an adversary-initiated threat that disrupted
infrastructure. The public demonstrated a great need for control over the situation,
through preparedness and information. For example, many Americans took protective
measures, despite the astronomical odds against infection. The news media were saturated
with reports of anthrax infections, suspected infections, and general information
about anthrax and how to respond to infection. Though no culprit was apprehended, the
attacks stopped, and normal postal activity resumed.
Some Lessons Learned
Though the United States has not experienced a severe, widespread disruption to infrastructure
comparable to an EMP attack, the cases reviewed provide some practical direction
for predictions of behavior. For example, it can be expected that emotional reactions
such as shock and paralysis that have followed past disasters could be magnified in a
large-scale event such as an EMP attack. In particular, the paralysis of government assistance
entities, such as law enforcement and emergency services, would aggravate this
effect. In most instances, social disorder would be minimal, in significant part, due to the
knowledge that authorities are in control of the situation. Without that assurance from an
outside source, it appears likely that people would turn to immediate neighbors or community
members for information and support, if possible.
Following disruptive disasters, information is among the most pressing needs for individuals.
Not surprisingly, people’s first concerns are the whereabouts and safety of their
family members and friends. Another urgent priority is an understanding of the situation
— knowledge of what has happened, who and what is affected, and the cause of the
situation. A related yet distinct information need is for confirmation that the situation will
be resolved, either from common sense and experience, in the case of a small-scale disaster,
or from the involvement of local or federal authorities, in the case of a large-scale
disaster. Psychologists note that dramatic events force people to reexamine their basic
understanding about the world, and that survivors need to process an event before they
can fully absorb it. This information processing begins the alternating phases of intrusion
and avoidance that are primary indicators of post-traumatic stress.14
The aftermath of natural disasters is often marked by instances or a period of considerable
pro-social behavior such as cooperation, social solidarity, and acts of selflessness.
However, this encouraging observation might not be similarly magnified in projections
for human behavior following an EMP attack. The key intangible, immeasurable difference
is the knowledge that normal order would resume, based on significant indicators.
It is important to note some of the differences between natural disasters and technological
disasters, particularly those caused by human intent. Natural disasters “create a social
context marked by an initial overwhelming consensus regarding priorities and the allocation
of resources,”15 which explains the enormous outpouring of voluntary support
following the floods of 1993. In contrast to natural disasters, which “occur as purpose-

181
less, asocial events; civil disturbances can be viewed as instrumentally initiated to
achieve certain social goals.”16 An EMP attack would certainly be perceived similarly,
whether the adversary were a terrorist organization or a state.
The selected case studies provide only an approximation of EMP effects. For example,
the effects of the knowledge that widespread infrastructure disruption resulted from an
intentional foreign attack are yet unknown. Much evidence points to people’s resilience
in the immediate aftermath of disasters. However, during a lengthy recovery process, as
would be expected following an EMP attack with widespread, long-duration effects, the
psychological effects of the attack should not be underestimated.
It appears clear that the most crucial question in the task of avoiding social disorder is
how to establish communication without electricity immediately following an EMP
attack. Without communication alternatives, it would be impossible to alert people to the
availability of emergency supplies or inform them concerning emergency response
activities. It also appears clear that greater awareness of the nature of an EMP attack and
knowledge of what prudent preparations might be undertaken to mitigate its consequences
would be desirable. Accordingly we make the following recommendations.
Recommendations
􀂋 Support to national leadership should involve measures to ensure that the President
can communicate effectively with the citizenry.
􀂋 Because many citizens would be without power, communications, and other services
for days — or perhaps substantially longer — before full recovery could occur, during
that interval, it will be crucial to provide a reliable channel of information to citizens
to let them know what has happened, what the current situation is, when help of what
types might be available, what their governments are doing, and answers to the host of
other questions that, if not answered, would almost certainly create more instability
and suffering for the affected individuals, communities, and the Nation as a whole. In
particular:
— The Department of Homeland Security should play a leading role in spreading
knowledge of the nature of prudent mitigation preparations for EMP attack to mitigate
its consequences.
— The Department of Homeland Security should add content to Web sites it maintains,
such as www.Ready.gov, which provides concise overviews of the threats
posed by EMP attacks and geomagnetic storms, summarizes steps that people
should take given an incident and identifies alternate or emergency communications
channels.
— The Department of Homeland Security should work with state homeland security
organizations to develop and exercise communications networks involving the
organizations that normally operate in each community.

Appendix A. The Commission and Its Charter
The Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse
(EMP) Attack was established by Congress through Title XIV of Public Law 106-398.
Looking out 15 years, the Commission was tasked to assess:
1) The nature and magnitude of potential high-altitude EMP threats to the United
States from all potentially hostile states or non-state actors that have or could
acquire nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles enabling them to perform a highaltitude
EMP attack against the United States within the next 15 years.
2) The vulnerability of United States military and especially civilian systems to an
EMP attack, giving special attention to vulnerability of the civilian infrastructure
as a matter of emergency preparedness.
3) The capability of the United States to repair and recover from damage inflicted on
United States military and civilian systems by an EMP attack.
4) The feasibility and cost of hardening select military and civilian systems against
EMP attack.
The Commission was also tasked to recommend any steps it believes should be taken
by the United States to better protect its military and civilian systems from EMP attack.
In accord with its charter, the Commission focused on the electromagnetic pulse produced
by high-altitude nuclear weapon detonations, as opposed to other types of nuclear
and non-nuclear EMP phenomena. Unless clearly indicated to the contrary, all references
to EMP are to the electromagnetic pulse produced by a high-altitude nuclear detonation.
This report presents the unanimous conclusions and recommendations of the Commissioners.
Organization
Commissioners were nominated by the Secretary of Defense and by the Administrator
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency1:
􀂋 Dr. William R. Graham (Chairman)
􀂋 Dr. John S. Foster, Jr.

􀂋 Dr. Joan B. Woodard
Commissioners brought to this task a wide range of expertise, including service as an
advisor to the President; senior management experience in both civilian and military
agencies, National Laboratories, and the corporate sector; management and operation of
national infrastructures, and technical expertise in the design of nuclear weapons and in
the hardening of systems against nuclear weapon effects. Commissioner resumes are provided

Dr. Michael J. Frankel served as Executive Director of the Commission. He was also
responsible for overseeing the technical efforts in support of the Commission accomplished
by both American and foreign organizations. The Institute for Defense Analysis,
under the leadership of Dr. Rob Mahoney, provided staff and facilities support for the
Commission. Dr. Peter Pry provided liaison with the Congress. The Commission also
benefited from the understanding of EMP available in foreign institutions. Several government,
non-profit, and commercial organizations conducted work and prepared reports
for the Commission.
Method
The Commission employed a capabilities-
based methodology to assess potential
high-altitude EMP threats to the United
States over the next 15 years.2 To this end
it engaged the current Intelligence Community,
sponsored the acquisition of new
test data and performed analytic studies as
input to the independent assessment developed
by the Commission. Fifteen years is a
very long time horizon. Many developments
are possible, to include actions by
the United States and others that can shape this future in a variety of ways. At the
Commission’s inception, Iraq was a state of concern from the standpoint of nuclear
proliferation and potential EMP threats. Due to actions taken by the Coalition, such Iraqi
capabilities are no longer a current concern.
The Commission did not attempt to forecast the relative likelihood of alternative WMD
threat scenarios. Instead, it sponsored research and reviewed existing assessments to
identify the capabilities that might be available to adversaries, with particular emphasis
on ballistic missile and nuclear weapons needed for EMP attacks.
The Commission’s charter encompassed all types of high-altitude EMP threats. The
Commission made a decision to focus most of its efforts on the most feasible of these
threats – EMP attacks involving one or a few weapons that could cause serious damage to
the functioning of the United States as a society or result in undermining national support
to American forces during a regional contingency.
Activities
The Commission received excellent support from the Intelligence Community, particularly
the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security
Agency, and Department of Energy Office of Intelligence. National Nuclear Security
Administration laboratories (Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia), the Navy,
and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency provided excellent technical support to the
Commission’s analyses. While it benefited from these inputs, the Commission developed
an independent assessment, and is solely responsible for the content of its research,
conclusions, and recommendations in this report.

The Commission also reviewed relevant foreign research and programs, and assessed
foreign perspectives on EMP attacks.
In considering EMP, the Commission also gave attention to the coincident nuclear
effects that would result from a high-altitude detonation that produces EMP, e.g., possible
disruption of the operations of, or damage to, satellites in a range of orbits around the
Earth.
In addition to examining potential threats, the Commission was charged to assess U.S.
vulnerabilities (civilian and military) to EMP and to recommend measures to counter
EMP threats. For these purposes, the Commission reviewed research and best practices
within the United States and other countries.
Early in this review it became apparent that only limited EMP vulnerability testing had
been accomplished for modern electronic systems and components. To partially remedy
this deficit, the Commission sponsored illustrative testing of current systems and infrastructure
components.

FS LIVE TRAFFIC SOFTWARE FOR FLIGHT SIMULATOR FSX





 FREE KEY COMMAND GUIDE SHEET 

Many flight simmers, especially the more novice users, have a hard time remembering the numerous key commands associated with Flight Simulator. From flaps to lights to ATC commands, it can certainly get confusing. That's why we've put together a handy spreadsheet featuring over 500 commands, labeled and formatted to fit over a key on a standard keyboard. Simply cut them out and affix them to your keys as needed. You could even take an extra keyboard that you might have laying around and utilize it exclusively for flight sim. You can customize it any way you'd like, even edit the commands to your preference. Best of all, it's completely free! Here at FSPilotShop we want to help you get the most out of flight simulation!

Microsoft Flight Simulator X (known in the Flight Simulator community also as simply FSX, of which the X is pronounced ten, as in the Roman numeral) is the latest version of Microsoft Flight Simulator after Flight Simulator 2004. It includes a graphics engine upgrade as well as compatibility with Windows Vista, having been hailed by Microsoft as the most important technological milestone in the series to date. It is the first version in the flight simulator series to be released on DVD-ROM. 
Flight Simulator X marks the tenth version of the popular line of simulators. It was officially released to the US market on October 17, 2006. According to Microsoft's Web site for the game, a standard edition features everything from navaids to GPS and airways. It also includes 18 planes, 28 detailed cities, and 40 highly detailed airports. The deluxe version features 24 types of aircraft, 38 highly detailed cities, and 45 highly detailed airports.

Flight Simulator X was officially unveiled at the 2006 international Consumer Electronics Show as a gaming showcase for Microsoft Windows Vista. Microsoft released screenshots as well as a list of frequently asked questions as a press release on Microsoft Flight Simulator Insider, as well as numerous flight simulator communities. This also included mission-based gameplay with mission specific aircraft as well as an upgraded rendering engine capable of increased detail.

Following the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 2006, Microsoft published new screenshots, videos and an official trailer. The overall reaction by the community was quite positive, and the graphical quality of the simulator has greatly increased.

Standard vs. Deluxe Edition
 Flight Simulator X was released in two editions, Standard and Deluxe. Deluxe edition incorporates some additional features, including an on-disc Software Development Kit (SDK), three airplanes with the Garmin G1000 Flight Deck, and player Air Traffic Control.

In addition, the Deluxe Edition features 24 aircraft compared to 18 in the Standard Edition, 45 high-detail airports compared to 40, 38 high-detail cities compared to 28, and 50+ structured missions compared to 30+.

New features
 The presently known new features in Flight Simulator X include:

Improved graphics including enhanced texture resolution, new Earth model facilitating polar flights, true road data, region-specific textures, 3D animals, star constellations, etc. Also, the scenery textures now line up with the automatically generated (Autogen) buildings. Maximum rendering-engine-supported scenery resolution of 7cm/pixel (not available with default scenery).

Improved default airport functionality — appropriate dynamic vehicles, jetways etc. Now featured by default where they exist in reality. 
 The built-in GPS support has been upgraded to include Garmin G1000 integrated glass cockpit, (select aircraft in the Deluxe version only). 
 Improved ATC featuring certain non-FAA procedures where appropriate (for example, altimeter/QNH scale in European units) and numerous minor updates such as an improved progressive-taxi feature.

Improved and new default aircraft including, for example, an Airbus A321. Default aircraft systems modeling is rather extensively improved, featuring, for example, APU, fire protection, passenger advisory sign switches etc. Improved weather system, including better visibility modeling. 
 Revamped multiplayer functionality featuring Shared Skies, a feature allowing multiple users to share the same cockpit. 
 Tower Controller, a feature in the Deluxe version allowing users to simulate local control at many airports worldwide during multiplayer gaming. 
 Revamped sound system with support for 5.1 surround sound. 

Proprietary SimConnectAPI to allow FSUIPC-like access to Flight Simulator functions and variables.
 Mission engine allowing creation of dynamic missions with developer control of many simulation variables, sound file playback, AI aircraft traffic etc. in relation to what the user is doing — essentially an evolution over the APL and ABL adventure programming languages featured in previous versions of the software. Dozens of missions ship with the product, and a mission level editor is expected to be released on-line shortly after release of the main product. 
 Most of the vintage aircraft that were a key theme in the previous version have been dropped, with the exception of the DC-3 and Piper J-3. Both aircraft are featured in the default missions that ship with the product. 

The maximum altitude in the game has been increased to 100,000,000 feet (30,000,000 m), as opposed to FS2004's 99,999 feet (30,480 m). FSX's maximum altitude is therefore approximately 2.39 times the diameter of the Earth at the equator. 
 Camera shake in the virtual cockpit as the aircraft banks, accelerates, brakes, flies through turbulence etc. 
 Realistic flexible wings in some commercial airplanes, the wings flex when the aircraft is going through turbulence, increasing rate of ascent or descending, major plane movements, flaps being fully extended, general vibrations to the plane, etc. An example of an aircraft with this wing movement is the Boeing 747-400. 
 New water effect which has 3D waves with curled up object reflection according to the wave movements and with sunshine reflection. 
 Aircraft can cast shadows on themselves.

Missions and rewards
 The inclusion of Missions adds a new facet to the simulation, adding task oriented goals, and encouraging users to fly worldwide, rather than just from their home field. Although a similar concept was available in previous versions, the new implementation of multipath & event oriented situations substantially extends the potential for user interaction.

Pilots earn Rewards for completing various missions, and reaching specific accomplishments throughout the game, (in 'Free Flight'). Some of the rewards exist as hidden "easter eggs" to be discovered by pilots. Some missions have multiple and hidden rewards, receipt being dependent on performing additional actions.

Some hidden rewards include:

Earning a postcard for spotting an item of interest. 
 Earning a badge for landing at a special airport i.e., highest, most remote, lowest. 
 Earning a reward for completing a challenge not associated with a mission. 
 Earning a trophy for landing a number of times or the number of airports landed at. 
 In each mission description, a map is included with it. It notes that they are for entertainment purposes. The maps and charts are supplied by Jeppesen

Microsoft released their first expansion pack for Flight Simulator in years, called Flight Simulator X: Acceleration, to the US market on Oct 23, 2007 rated E+10, and released to the Australian market on Nov 1, 2007 rated G. Acceleration introduces new features, including multiplayer air racing, new missions, and three all-new aircraft, the F/A-18A Hornet, EH-101 helicopter and the P-51 Mustang. Unfortunately, in many product reviews, users complained of multiple bugs in the initial release of the pack. One of the bugs, which occurs only in the Standard Edition of Flight Simulator X, is that the Maule Air Orion aircraft used in the mission has missing gauges and other problems, as it is a Deluxe Version-only aircraft.

The new scenery enhancements cover Berlin, Istanbul, Cape Canaveral and the Edwards Air Force Base, providing high accuracy both in the underlying photo texture (1m/pix) and in the detail given to the 3D objects.

Flight Simulator X: Acceleration takes advantage of Windows Vista as well as DirectX 10

Downloadable content
 There are many downloads that both versions of Flight Simulator X can use, ranging from free aircraft and paint jobs to commercial, high-resolution scenery. They may change many aspects of the simulator, such as adjusting the visuals, gameplay, adding new features or content such as scenery objects and modifications. Numerous free downloads are available from community websites and the downloads include, but are not limited to:
 Civil jets 
 Prop planes
