1.	Basic Hydraulics
 
Fluid Density (ρ)

ρ = mass / volume

 

The mass of 1m³ of water is 1000 kg (1 tonne). 

ρ for water = 1000kg/m³



Specific Gravity (SG)

Specific Gravity = density of fluid / density of water.


Densities of some typical liquids

Fluid	ρ (kg/m³)
Petrol	750
Pure Alcohol	790
Mineral Oil	920
Water	1000
Nitric Acid	1500
Mercury	13600


 
Absolute Viscosity (μ)

Viscosity is the resistance to fluid flow (shear)

 

For a Newtonian fluid the shear stress is proportional to the rate of shear.
τ = F/A   α   ∂u / ∂y	τ = μ ∂u / ∂y   

μ is the absolute or dynamic viscosity measured in Ns/m2

1 Ns/m2 = 1000cP
 
1 poise (P) = 100 centipoise (cP)

Note: Viscosity is very temperature dependant 
Kinematic Viscosity (ν)

Kinematic viscosity is the ratio of the viscous force to the inertial force. 

Kinematic Viscosity ν = μ / ρ

Kinematic viscosity = Absolute Viscosity / Density

ν is the kinematic viscosity measured in m2/s

Note: Centrifugal pumps become inefficient when pumping very viscous liquids.  Larger pumps suffer less. Positive displacement pumps are more suitable for pumping very viscous liquids 
Pressure (P)
Pabsolute = Pgauge + Patmospheric

Standard atmospheric pressure = 1.01325 bar abs = 0 bar gauge

1 bar = 105 N/m² = 10.2 m H2O = 750mm Hg 

Note. Always compare like with like. Don’t use a mix of absolute and gauge pressures. For calculation purposes use absolute pressure.

Where:	A = flow area
		Vm = mean flow velocity
		ρ = density

 
 
Velocity Head (Hv)
Vm = Q/A = 4 x Q / π x d2

 


Where: 	Hv = velocity head (m)
		Q = volumetric flow rate (m3/s)
		d = pipe bore (m)

Measuring Total Pump Head Rise (centrifugal relift pump)

 


Total Pump Head Rise (centrifugal relift pump) 

Head Rise (H) = ((Pd - Ps) / ρg) + ((Vd2 - Vs2) / 2g) + (hd – hs)

ρ = density of fluid (kg/m3)
g = gravitational constant (9.81m/s²)

Measuring Total Pump Head Rise (submersible pump)

 


Total Pump Head Rise (submersible pump)

Head Rise (H) = (Pd / ρg) + (Vd2 / 2g) + h

ρ = density of fluid (kg/m3)
g = gravitational constant (9.81m/s²)
Vd = mean velocity in discharge pipe (m/s)
Pd = discharge pressure (N/m2)
h = height above liquid level in wet well (m)
 
Types of Fluid Flow

Laminar Flow - Fluid flow in which adjacent layers do not mix except on the molecular scale 
In laminar flow viscous forces dominate.

Turbulent Flow - Fluid flow in which the particle motion at any point varies rapidly in magnitude and direction
In Turbulent flow inertia forces dominate

Reynolds Number (Re)

The Reynolds number may be described as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and, consequently, it quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions

Re = ρ V d / μ = inertia forces / viscous forces

ρ = density of fluid (kg/m3)
μ = absolute or dynamic viscosity (Ns/m2)
V = mean velocity (m/s)
d = hydraulic diameter (m)
dcircular pipe = 4 x cross sectional area / wetted perimeter
(The wetted perimeter is the perimeter of the cross sectional area that is "wet" excluding any free surfaces where the liquid is not in contact with the pipe)

 
The transition between laminar and turbulent flow in circular pipes is generally accepted to be at about Re = 2300. Avoid any pipe configuration within the range 2000 to 3000 to ensure the flow is either fully laminar or fully turbulent.


2. Pump Types & Characteristics
 
Centrifugal Pumps

The rotating impeller of a centrifugal pump converts the shaft power of the motor into increased fluid velocity and hence kinetic energy of the liquid.  This kinetic energy is converted into pressure energy as the liquid passes through the pump casing.


Characteristics of Centrifugal Pumps

•	Relatively cheap, simple and very common.
•	Capable of handling high flows
•	Output strongly dependant on resistance to flow
•	Compact for a given capacity
•	Not self-priming
•	Not suitable for high pressure or high viscosity applications


Centrifugal Pump Characteristic 
(Pump Curve, Efficiency Curve, Power Curve)

 
Notes: 
•	Curves are for specific liquids e.g. Water
•	Power curve is typically pump shaft input power
•	BEP is at maximum efficiency
 
Centrifugal Pump Types

 

 
Positive Displacement Pumps

In a positive displacement pump either rotary or linear motion is used to force pockets of liquid through the pump casing.

Positive displacement pumps will draw upon the available power to overcome resistance to flow.

Characteristics of Positive Displacement Pumps

•	Output largely independent of resistance to flow (suitable for accurate measurement)
•	Suitable for high pressure and high viscosity applications
•	Self-priming capability 
•	Produce a pulsating flow
•	Tend to be large and complex for their capacity

(d1  d2) 			(N1  N2)		   (d1  d2) & (N1  N2)

(Q2 / Q1) = (d2 / d1)		(Q2 / Q1) = (N2 / N1)	   (Q2 / Q1) = (d2 x N2/ d1 x N1)

Q2 = Q1 x (d2 / d1)		Q2 = Q1 x (N2 / N1)	   Q2 = Q1 x (d2 x N2/ d1 x N1)


Flow is directly proportional to diameter and speed.

(H2 / H1) = (d2 / d1)2		(H2 / H1) = (N2 / N1)2	   (H2 / H1) = (d2 N2/ d1 N1)2

H2 = H1 x (d2 / d1)2		H2 = H1 x (N2 / N1)2	   H2 = H1 x (d2 x N2/ d1 x N1)2

Head is proportional to the square of diameter and speed.

(d1  d2) 			(N1  N2)		   (d1  d2) & (N1  N2)

(P2 / P1) = (d2 / d1)3		(P2 / P1) = (N2 / N1)3	   (P2 / P1) = (d2 N2/ d1 N1)3

P2 = P1 x (d2 / d1)3		P2 = P1 x (N2 / N1)3	   P2 = P1 x (d2 x N2/ d1 x N1)3

Power (P) is proportional to the cube of diameter and speed.

 
Variable Speed Pumping

Hydraulic Work Done (kW) = Pu = (ρgQH) / 1000

ρ = density (kg/m³)
g = gravitational constant = 9.81 (m/s²) 
Q = volumetric flow rate (m3/s)
H = Total head rise across the pump (m)

Pp = ρgQH / ηp

ηp = pump efficiency


Input power to motor: -

Specific Speed (nω)

Specific Speed is a number that relates pump speed, flow rate and head rise at the best efficiency operating condition of the pump to impeller geometry and hydraulic performance.

nω = (ω x  Qbep) / (g x H bep)0.75

Solo Pump Operation

 
 
A fixed speed pump can only operate at head/flow combinations described by its pump curve. The pump curve is a characteristic of the pump. 

A pumping main or system has a series of possible head/flow combinations described by its system curve. The system curve is a characteristic of the pumping main/system.

When a fixed speed pump is pumping into a system, it will operate at the point at which its pump curve intersects the system curve.

A pump that is designed to run solo is selected to have its best efficiency point at the solo operating point.

Note: Not all pumps are designed to run solo. Pumps can also be designed to run in parallel and can be selected to have their best efficiency point at a parallel pumping operating point.

 
Pumps Operating in Parallel
 

 

When a pair of fixed speed pumps operate together in parallel their pump curves are added together to make a combined pump curve. The combined pump curve is a characteristic of the “pump pair” operating in parallel. 

The pumping main / system head/flow system curve remains unchanged. 

When the “pump pair” operates together parallel pumping into the system, they will operate at the point at which the combined pump curve intersects the system curve.

Parallel pumping is generally used to increase flow rate. However, as the flowrate in the system increases, the friction element in the total head becomes more significant, so a system curve would need to be very flat indeed for parallel pumping achieve a (near) doubling of the solo flow rate.
 
Pumps Operating in Series

 

 

When a two fixed speed pumps operate together in series their pump curves are added together to make a series pump curve. The combined pump curve is a characteristic of the “pump pair” operating in series. 

The pumping main / system head/flow system curve remains unchanged. 

When the “pump pair” operates together in series pumping into the system, they will operate at the point at which the combined pump curve intersects the system curve.

Series pumping is generally used to boost water pumped to a primary destination by the first pump, onward to a secondary higher destination. The second pump utilises the discharge pressure of the first pump as increased suction head.
 
 

3. System Characteristics
 
Pump Operating Point

 

A fixed speed pump can only operate at head/flow combinations described by its pump curve. The pump curve is a characteristic of the pump. 

A pumping main / system has a series of possible head/flow combinations described by its system curve. The system curve is a characteristic of the pumping main/system.

When a fixed speed pump is pumping into a system, it will operate at the point at which its pump curve intersects the system curve.

Components of a System Curve

•	The difference in levels of the liquid surfaces in the suction and discharge vessels (static head).
•	Difference in pressures on the liquid surfaces in the suction and discharge vessels.
•	Friction losses in components and pipework
•	Entrance and exit losses
 
A Typical Pump System

 
System Head

H = Hs + Hd

System Head = Static Head (Hs) + Dynamic Head (Hd)

Static Head (Hs) is independent of flowrate

Hs = ((Pd - Ps) / ρg) + h

Note: Static head will change as the levels fall and rise in the suction and discharge vessels.

Dynamic Head (Hd), also known as Friction Head, is proportional to the square of the flowrate.

System Curve
 
 
System Efficiency (ηsys)

To minimise wasted energy the dynamic head should be as low as practicable.

System Efficiency

ηsys = Hs / Hs + Hd

Note: A refurbished pump may deliver an increased flow which will increase the dynamic head thus consuming more energy to pump the same volume of water!  Be aware of the big picture.

Pipe Friction Losses

The D’Arcy formula is used to calculate pipe friction losses: -

ΔH = 4fLV2 / 2dg		(European SI Based)

ΔH = head loss (m)
f = friction factor
L = length of pipe (m)
V = mean flow velocity (m/s)
d = hydraulic diameter (m)
dcircular pipe = 4 x cross sectional area / wetted perimeter

(The wetted perimeter is the perimeter of the cross sectional area that is "wet", i.e in contact with the pipe)

g = gravitational constant = 9.81 (m/s²)

Note: the friction factor will need to be estimated (see below)

In the USA a different form of the D’Arcy formula is used: -

ΔH = fLV2 / 2dg		(USA Imperial Based)

The reason for the difference is the type of friction factor used. It is essential that the right version of the D'Arcy equation be used with the selected friction factor. Matching the wrong equation to the wrong friction factor will result in a 400% error and it is therefore important that the correct combination of equation and friction factor is utilised.
 
Estimating Pipe Head Loss

Data Required: -
•	Flow rate
•	Pipe dimensions (bore, length, roughness)
•	Properties of liquid (density, viscosity)

Calculations: -
•	Mean flow velocity (from flowrate & bore)
•	Reynolds Number (from density, absolute viscosity, mean velocity & hydraulic diameter)
•	Friction factor (from Reynolds number and roughness by chosen formulae or Moody Chart)
•	Head loss (D’Arcy formula)

Reynolds Number (Re)

The Reynolds number may be described as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and, consequently, it quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions

Re = ρ V d / μ = inertia forces / viscous forces

ρ = density of fluid (kg/m3)
μ = absolute or dynamic viscosity (Ns/m2)
V = mean velocity (m/s)
d = hydraulic diameter (m)
dcircular pipe = 4 x cross sectional area / wetted perimeter

 
Friction Factor (f)

The friction factor in the D’Arcy formula needs to be estimated. The friction factor depends on the Reynolds number (Re) of the flowing liquid and the relative roughness (k/d) of the inside of the pipe.

For smooth pipes and liquids with low Reynolds number use Poiseuille’s formula for laminar flow: -

f = 16 / Re		(Re <2100)

For liquids with high Reynolds number you can try the Colebrooke & White formula for turbulent flow: -

1 /  f = -4log10 (( k / 3.7d ) + ( 1.255 / Re  f))	(Re >3000)

k = the average height of the roughness projections

Blasius’s formula for smooth pipe turbulent flow: -

f = 0.079 / Re0.25

Estimation of friction factor for turbulent flow: -

f = 0.0625 / (log10 ((k / 3.7d) + (5.74 / Re0.9))) 2

Pipe Roughness Values (k)

k = the average height of the roughness projections

Pipe Material / Condition	Roughness (k (mm)) 
Drawn brass, copper	0.0025
Glass, Perspex, fibreglass	0.0025
New smooth steel pipe	0.025
Cast iron	0.15
Light rust	0.25
Water mains with tuberculations	1.2
Mature foul sewer	3.0
Pre-cast concrete	0.25
Corrugated plastic	3.5

 
Moody Chart

The Moody Chart is used for estimating the friction factor from the Reynolds number and relative roughness (pipe roughness / pipe bore).
Moody Chart (ΔH = 4fLV2 / 2dg)
 

Note: The Moody Chart comes in two different versions. Make sure you know if a Moody Chart is for the formula with or without the 4.

For the European D’Arcy formula: -

ΔH = 4fLV2 / 2dg		(European SI Based)

For the USA D’Arcy formula: -

ΔH = fLV2 / 2dg		(USA Imperial Based)
Hazen & Williams Formula for Water

A useful method to estimate pipe friction losses is the Hazen & Williams formula for water: -

ΔH = 1214.6 L (100/Chw)1.852 x (Q1.852 / d1.852)

ΔH = Straight pipe pressure loss (m)
Chw = Hazen & Williams friction factor
Q = Volumetric Flowrate (l/min)
d = Pipe bore (mm)
L = Pipe length (m)

The empirical nature of the friction factor (Chw) makes the Hazen & Williams formula unsuitable for accurate prediction of head loss.
Note: The Hazen & Williams friction factor (Chw) bears no relation to friction factor (f) associated with the D’Arcy formula above.


Hazen & Williams Friction Factors (Chw)


Pipe Material	Friction Factor (Chw)
Smooth unlined cast iron	130
Asphalted cast iron	140
Very smooth cement	130-140
Ordinary cement	110-120
Drawn steel or wrought iron	130-140
Riveted steel	90-110

 
The Importance of Pipe Diameter

Head loss is highly susceptible to pipe diameter:  H α d5

 
Estimating Fitting Losses

Pipe configuration, fixtures and fittings will result in head loss.

ΔH = K (V2 / 2g) = K x Hv

K = fitting loss coefficient
Hv = velocity head (m)
V = mean velocity upstream of the fitting (m/s)

Suction pipework of larger diameter than discharge pipework should be chosen to avoid cavitation.
 
4. Cavitation
 
Cavitation

•	Cavitation is the boiling of liquid at low pressures and normal temperatures to form bubbles of vapour. It occurs when when the local pressure falls sufficiently far below the saturated vapor pressure of the liquid.
•	The bubbles of vapour resulting from the liquid boiling will eventually collapse to a minute fraction of their original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid via a rather violent mechanism, which releases a significant amount of energy largely in the form of an acoustic shock-wave but also in part as visible light. 
•	Although the collapse of bubbles is a relatively low energy event, highly localized collapses can erode metals, such as steel, over time. At the point of total collapse, the temperature of the vapor within the bubble may be several thousand degrees kelvin, and the pressure several hundred atmospheres. The pitting caused by the collapse of bubbles produces great wear on components and can dramatically shorten a pump's lifetime.
•	Cavitation causes: -
o	Mechanical Damage
o	Performance deterioration
o	Noise and vibration

Bernoulli’s Equation

(P/ρg) + (V2/2g) + h = constant

Pressure Energy + Kinetic Energy + Potential Energy = Constant

In a centrifugal pump liquid is drawn in through the suction manifold. The rotating impeller converts the shaft power of the motor into increased fluid velocity, reaching a maximum velocity, and hence maximum kinetic energy of the liquid, at the rim of the impeller.  Much of this kinetic energy is then converted into pressure energy as the liquid passes through the pump casing.

As the kinetic energy of the liquid increases in the pump, its pressure falls, only to increase again as the kinetic energy is converted to pressure as the liquid leaves the pump.
 
Vapour Pressure

 
If you decrease pressure enough a liquid will boil.


Pressure Distribution


 
If Pmin falls below the vapour pressure of the liquid it will boil causing cavitation.
 
Cavitation
 
Bubbles created as the liquid boils under low pressure at the inlet get carried along by the flow and collapse implosively as the pressure increases at the outlet.  Vapour volume is 150,000 times the same liquid volume (water), so efficiency is greatly reduced.

Net Positive Suction Head Available (NPSHA)

 

NPSHA = (PS – PV /ρg) – hs - hs loss

PV = Vapour Pressure of the pumped fluid at the operating temperature

NPSHA is a function of the pumping system and should be designed to be as large as possible.
 
Net Positive Suction Head Required (NPSHR)
NPSHR is a function of the design of the pump.  For a pump to work properly, NPSHA must be greater than NPSHR: you must have more suction head available in the system than required by the pump.
When NPSHA is less than NPSHR, the pump will either cavitate and operate at a reduced performance condition, or the pump will not operate at all.

Onset of Cavitation as NPSHA falls below NPSHR (NPSH-3)  
 
NPSHR (NPSH-3) is the suction pressure limit at which the pump's total differential head performance is reduced by 3% due to cavitation. It's important to note that cavitation occurs at suction pressure levels above the NPSH-3 level and pump damage can occur from cavitation even though the pump may continue to provide the expected hydraulic performance.
 
Cavitation Free Performance
 
To ensure pump performance is cavitation free, NPSHA must be maintained well above NPSHR (NPSH-3).

NPSH Margin
The difference between NPSHA and NPSHR is known as the NPSH Margin.
 
 
Typical NPSH Margins

Application	NPSH Margin (% of NPSHR) 
Cold Water	35 - 50
Hydrocarbons	10
Small Boiler Feed Pumps	50 [1]
High Energy Pumps	100 – 200 [2]
[1]	Pumps up to 1850kW and 3600 rpm
[2]	Where the impeller inlet peripheral velocity is greater than 25 m/s
Cavitation and Pump Performance
 
The onset of cavitation is marked by a rapid decrease in developed head. This is accompanied by a rapid decrease in pump efficiency.
 
Cavitation and Pump Noise
 
Cavitation usually produces noise. The noise is generated by the implosion of the vapour bubbles. This can sound like gravel passing through the pump. In extreme cases cavitation can be almost silent due to the sound insulation properties of the vapour bubbles cushioning the noise of the implosions.
 
Maximum Lift
As a pump is positioned higher above an open suction tank the NPSHA reduces until cavitation occurs. The maximum lift is dependant on atmospheric pressure and vapour pressure of the fluid.
 
Maximum Suction Lift

NPSHA = (PS – PV /ρg) – hs - hs loss

PV = Vapour Pressure of the pumped fluid at the operating temperature

hs = (PS – PV /ρg) - hs loss – NPSHA 

NPSHA = NPSHR + Margin 

hs = (PS – PV /ρg) - hs loss – (NPSHR + Margin)
The real maximum lift possible is only about four meters. 
Maximum elevation of a pump above an open water tank 
The maximum elevation or suction head for an open tank will depend on atmospheric pressure (which in general can be regarded as constant) and the vapour pressure of the fluid (which will vary with temperature, especially for water).
he = Patm / ρg – PV / ρg

Patm = Atmospheric Pressure 
ρ = density of liquid kg/m³
g = gravitational constant = 9.81m/s
PV = Absolute vapour pressure of Water
The absolute vapour pressure of water at 20°C is 2.3kN/m2, and Atmospheric pressure is 101.33kN/m2, therefore the maximum theoretical elevation height is: -
he = (101.33) / (1000 x 9.81) - (2.3) / (1000 x 9.81) = 10.1 m
This theoretical value will vary significantly with temperature due to the temperature dependence of the vapour pressure of water.
 
The maximum theoretical elevation of a pump above an open water tank at different temperatures can be found in the following table: - 
Temperature (°C)	Vapour Pressure (kN/m2)	Maximum Elevation (m)
0	0.6	10.3
5	0.9	10.2
10	1.2	10.2
15	1.7	10.2
20	2.3	10.1
25	3.2	10
30	4.3	9.9
35	5.6	9.8
40	7.7	9.5
45	9.6	9.4
50	12.5	9.1
55	15.7	8.7
60	20	8.3
65	25	7.8
70	32.1	7.1
75	38.6	6.4
80	47.5	5.5
85	57.8	4.4
90	70	3.2
95	84.5	1.7
100	101.33	0

Due to the head losses in suction pipework and the local conditions inside the pump the practical maximum elevation is significantly less than these theoretical values.  The practical maximum lift possible at 20°C is only about four meters. 
Suction Specific Speed
Sω = (ω x  Qbep) / (g x NPSHR bep)0.75

ω = pump speed (rad/sec)
Qbep = flowrate at best efficiency point (m3/s)
NPSHR bep = Net Positive Suction Head Required at best efficiency point (m)
g = gravitational constant = 9.81 (m/s²)
Suction Specific Speed is generally between 2.5 and 4, typically 2.8, but with an Inducer fitted can be up to 8. An Inducer is a small impeller mounted on the eye of the main impeller to speed up input.
Estimating NPSHR
 

NPSHR can be estimated for pumps running at given rotational speeds and flow rates at a fixed specific speed.
 
Internal Recirculation

 

When the capacity of a pump is reduced by throttling (or by an increase in system head) recirculation can occur. Recirculation is a flow reversal at the suction and/or discharge tips if the impeller vanes. All impellers have a critical capacity at which recirculation occurs. Recirculation commonly occurs briefly as a pump is shut-off.

Suction recirculation is a reversal of flow at the impeller eye.  A rotating annulus of liquid is formed upstream of the impeller inlet. The axial flow corresponding to the output of the pump passes through the core of this annulus. The high shear rate between the annulus and axial flow creates vortices that form and collapse resulting in cavitation and noise. Suction recirculation produces a loud crackling noise about the suction end of a pump (louder than low NPSHA cavitation) and can be very damaging if it occurs during continuous operation of the pump.

Discharge recirculation is a reversal of flow at the discharge tips of the impeller vanes. The high shear rate between the inward and outward flows produces vortices that cause cavitation that attacks the pressure side of the vanes.  Discharge recirculation produces the same characteristic crackling noise about the discharge end of the pump and can be very damaging if it occurs during continuous operation of the pump.

Onset of Suction Recirculation 

 

The capacity at which suction recirculation occurs is directly related to the design suction specific speed of the pump. The higher the suction specific speed, the closer the onset of recirculation to the capacity at best efficiency.

Where recirculation during continuous pump operation occurs a number of possible corrective measures are available: -

•	Increase the output capacity of the pump
•	Install a bypass between the discharge and suction ends
•	Bleed air into the pump suction to reduce effects
•	Replace the impeller with one made of a harder material to reduce damage
 
Avoid Cavitation by Increasing NPSHA

The following corrective measures will increase NPSHA

•	Raise the level of liquid in the supply vessel
•	Lower the pump
•	Reduce the suction pipework losses (increase diameter)
•	Install a booster pump
•	Reduce the vapour pressure of the liquid by cooling it prior to pumping

Avoid Cavitation by Increasing NPSHR

The following corrective measures will increase NPSHR

•	Use a slower speed pump
•	Use a double suction impeller
•	Fit an impellor with a larger eye (beware of recirculation)
•	Use an oversize pump
•	Fit an inducer
•	Use several pumps operating in parallel

Comparing Single and Double Suction Impellers

Sω = (ω x  Qbep) / (g x NPSHR bep) 0.75

ω = pump speed (rad/sec)
Qbep = flowrate at best efficiency point (m3/s)
NPSHR bep = Net Positive Suction Head Required at best efficiency point (m)
g = gravitational constant = 9.81 (m/s²)

If Q2 = 0.5 x Q1

NPSHR2 = NPSHR1 ( 0.5 x Q1 /  Q1) 1.333

NPSHR2 = 0.63 x NPSHR1

So by using a double suction impeller a reduction of 27% NPSHR is achieved
 

 
5.	Costs of Pumping
 
The Cost of Pumping

The capital cost of a pump may seem high but it is quite small compared to the whole lifetime cost of the pump.

Some Facts and Figures

•	The initial capital cost of a pump is typically less than 5% of its total whole life costs
•	About 70% of all electric motors produced are used to drive pumps fans and compressors
•	There are over 10,000,000 electric motors in the UK and about 3,000 new motors are purchased every day
•	An electric motor consumes its own value in energy costs running for less than 30 days
•	The cost of the electricity used to drive pump motors in the UK is over £2,000 million a year

Why Pumps are Expensive to Operate

•	Pumps are normally powered by electric motors
•	Pumps often run in excess of 5,000 hours per year
•	Pumps wear in service reducing their operating efficiency
•	Pumps operating with reduced efficiency can still perform without any obvious problems
•	Pump duties are often over specified at the design stage of a scheme which can result in over-specified pumps that must operate some way below their best efficiency points
•	Pumps are often throttled to meet operational requirements
•	Variations in operational requirements can result in inefficient pumping regimes
•	Operating pumps inefficiently increases running wear and maintenance costs

 
Power Consumed in Pumping

Pgr = ρgQH / 1000 ηp ηm

Pgr = electrical power consumed (kW)
ρ = density of fluid (kg/m³)
g = gravitational constant = 9.81 (m/s²) 
Q = volumetric flow rate (m3/s)
H = head developed by the pump (m)
ηp = pump efficiency (decimal)

The Cost of Pumping

Annual Cost (£) = Pgr ntr / 100

Pgr = electrical power consumed (kW)

tr = tariff rate (p/kWh)

Annual Cost (£) = ρgQHntr / ηp ηm 105
Example

What is the annual cost of running a 100kW pump continuously for a year (8760 hours) at 8p/kWh?

Cost = 100 x 8760 x 8 / 100 = £ 70,080 (about £192 a day)

The Whole Lifetime Cost of a Pump

 
 
Why Pumps are Expensive

Energy Savings of 10 – 15% can typically be made by improving the efficiency of pumps

Energy Savings of 30-40% can typically be made by considering the performance of complete pumping systems

Energy Lost in Pumping

 

 
Efficiency Deterioration

 
Starting and stopping pumps is the cause of most deterioration.

Optimising Maintenance
 

 
Savings from Pump Refurbishment

P (kW) = (ρgQH / 1000) x (1 / η1 - 1 / η2)

Annual Saving (£) = (ρgQHntr / 105) x (1 / η1 - 1 / η2)

η1 = ηp1 x ηm1 = overall efficiency before refurbishment

η2 = ηp2 x ηm2 = overall efficiency after refurbishment

P = electrical power consumed (kW)
ρ = density of fluid (kg/m³)
g = gravitational constant = 9.81 (m/s²) 
Q = volumetric flow rate (m3/s)
H = head developed by the pump (m)
n = hours run per year (hrs) 
tr = tariff rate (p/kWh)
ηp = pump efficiency (decimal)
ηm = motor efficiency (decimal)


Savings from Pump Refurbishment

Assumptions: -

Q = 0.102 m3/s (= 8.81 Ml/d)
H = 100m
ρ = 1000 kg/m³ (water)
n = 8760 hrs (continuous running) 
tr = 8 p/kWh
η1 = 0.65
η2 = 0.75

Hydraulic Power = 100kW

Savings (£) = 100 x 8760 x 0.08 (1 / 0.65 - 1 / 0.75) = £14,716.80

 
The Effect of Oversizing Pumps

 
Pgr = ρgQH / ηp ηm

H = Hs + Hd 
&  
Hd α Q2

H = Hs + aQ2 where a = constant

Pgr = ρgQ (Hs + aQ2) / ηp ηm

Pgr = ρgQHs + aρgQ3 / ηp ηm

So power is strongly flow dependent.

The Effect of Oversizing Pumps

•	Power consumption and operating costs are significantly increased

•	Pump operates to the right of the best efficiency flow rate

•	Increased risk of high flow cavitation
o	NPSHA reduces with flow, NPSHR increases with flow

•	Increased risk of overloading pump motor

The Design Process

 

The Supply Chain

 
The Clients message about running costs has to get to the equipment supplier, so the Specification has to be very good.

 
The Importance of Functional Specification

 

The Functional Specification

•	What is to be pumped and why?
•	Where is it to be pumped?
•	Where is it pumping from and where is it pumping to?
•	How will it interact with other existing or proposed installations?
•	Who will operate and maintain it?
•	How are any of these requirements likely to change?
 
Function of a Typical Pump System
 

ρ = density of liquid (kg/m³)
g = gravitational constant = 9.81m/s²
Q = volumetric flow rate (m3/s)
Hs = Static Head (m)

Energy Losses

•	Transformer and cable losses
o	2% – 4% for a well designed system
•	Variable speed drive losses
o	about 5% for a modern drive
•	Motor losses
o	4% - 10% depending on size and design
•	Pump losses
o	10% - 40% depending on design and duty
•	Pipework losses

 
Efficiency of Motors and Drives
 
Motor and Inverter drive efficiency is fairly flat except at low loads.

Pump Efficiency
 
Pump efficiency is strongly flow dependent and falls off sharply moving away from maximum efficiency point.

Pipework Losses
 

An Example

Flowrate	0.102 m3/s
Static Head	80 m
Dynamic Head	20 m
Fluid Density (water)	1000 kg/m3
Pump Efficiency	80%
Motor Efficiency	93%
Variable Speed Drive Efficiency 	95%
Transformer and Cable Efficiency	98%

A good pumping station, well designed system reasonable components having good values.  

From Wire to Water

	kW	%
Useful work done	80	56
Pipework losses	20	14
Pump losses	25	17
Motor losses	9	6
Drive losses	7	5
Transmission and cable losses	3	2
Total energy input	144	100

A well designed system with reasonable components having good values, yet still only 56 percent of power input ends up as useful work.
 
Specific Power Consumption (PS) (don’t confused with suction pressure)

PS = P/Q = ρ.g.HS/ηgr = Ws/m3 (watt seconds per cubic metre)

PS = ρ.g.HS/3600.ηgr = kWh/Ml

PS = specific power consumption (kWh/Ml)
ρ = density of fluid (kg/m³)
g = gravitational constant = 9.81 (m/s²) 
HS = static head (m)
ηgr = product of overall component efficiencies

This measure uses system static head, and so doesn’t include the variation in total pumping head that arises from friction losses. 

Specific Power Consumption (PS) Example

Using figures for the example above: -

PS = ρ.g.HS/3600.ηgr = (1000 x 9.81 x 80) / (3600 x 0.56)

PS = 389 kWh/Ml

Another very useful measure is Specific power consumption per metre of static head that can be used to compare the performance of competing designs: -

PS/Hs = kWh/Ml/m

Using figures for the example above: -

PS/Hs =389/80 = 4.9 kWh/Ml/m

 
General Overview

•	It is very important to evaluate the whole life costs of competing designs
•	Select appropriate equipment (it’s a no brainer)
o	high efficiency motors, efficiency enhancing coatings for pump internals
•	Minimise installation effects and hydraulic losses
•	Develop an effective system of operation, control and monitoring

Polymer Coatings
 
Efficiency derived from polymer coatings will last providing cavitation is avoided.

Some System Design Issues

Most apparent pump problems are in fact system problems and the majority of these are related to suction conditions.
•	allow generous suction pipework diameters with a minimum of bends and fittings
•	suction pipework should rise continuously into the pump suction end to avoid creating air pockets
•	sumps and suction tanks should be designed to avoid vortex formation

 
Effect of Entrained Air on Pump Performance
 
Increasing quantities of entrained air will progressively reduce pump performance.

Vortex Formation
 
Pump Sump Design Guides to Avoid Vortex Formation
 
Some Pump Selection Issues

Compare the power consumption across the operating range of each pump.
•	it may be more cost effective to sacrifice peak efficiency at the design flow for improved performance at lower flows
•	information is required on the range of flows required and the period of time spent at each flowrate.

Pump Load Profiles

 
Efficiency Characteristics

 
Radial flow pumps hold their efficiency over a wider range of design flows.

Some Pump Selection Issues

Do not oversize pumps to meet an anticipated increase in demand or system head which may never occur.
•	it is often more cost effective to replace the pump or fit a larger impeller when required
•	variable speed drives should not be used to accommodate short-comings in the design process

Sometimes optimum energy efficiency may have to be balanced against long term reliability.
•	for example, sewage pumps inevitably have to sacrifice some hydraulic efficiency for solids handling capability
•	the efficiency of multi-stage pumps can be increased by selecting a higher specific speed model but this leads to a lower head per stage, more stages, longer shafts and larger deflections

Pump Specification

The pump specification determines the capital cost and subsequent lifetime operating and maintenance expenditure. To minimise lifetime operating and maintenance costs, pump users, pump manufacturers and component & service suppliers must work closely together.

 
Pump Specification

Water Industry Mechanical and Electrical Specifications (WIMES) 1.01 to 1.11 cover a variety of pump type specifications that include standard data sheets.  These specifications typically include a large quantities of performance data.

•	General Performance Specification
o	mode of operation - solo, parallel, series

Conventional Pump Testing

 

In a conventional pump testing setup, pressure monitoring is used to measure both the suction and discharge pressure of the pump. A flowmeter is used to measure the pumped flowrate. 
Power metering is setup to measure the pump motor input power.  

The pump is run at operational speed and the discharge valve is progressively closed in steps to record measurements at a series of test points.  

 
 
The suction and discharge pressure measurements are used to calculate the head rise across the pump in meters at each test point.  

The pumped flowrate measurements are used to calculate the volumetric flowrate through the pump in litres per second at each test point.

The Problems of Measuring Flow On-site

•	A flowmeter may not be installed
•	If a flowmeter is installed it may not be calibrated
•	The flowmeter may be sized to measure the output of a number of pumps
•	The pipework configuration may be far from ideal

On-site Measurements of Flowmeter Uncertainty

% of Flowmeter Population	Uncertainty
25%	<5%
50%	5% to 10%
25%	>10%

In-service flowmeter tests show widespread inaccuracy. 

Thermodynamic Pump Testing

Efficiency = work out / work in

work in = work out + losses

work out = ρgQH
ρ = density (kg/m³)
g = gravitational constant = 9.81 (m/s²) 
Q = volumetric flow rate (m3/s)
H = total head rise across the pump (m)

Once the pumping system has reached thermal equilibrium, the energy losses from the system are almost exclusively in the guise of a temperature rise in the pumped liquid.

losses = ρQCpΔT
ρ = density (kg/m³)
Q = volumetric flow rate (m3/s)
Cp = specific heat capacity at constant pressure (J/kg.K)
ΔT = temperature rise across the pump

Efficiency = 1 / ((1 + CpΔT) / (gH))

Efficiency can therefore be calculated by measuring the head rise and temperature rise across the pump. This method of efficiency measurement does not rely on measuring the pumped flowrate. 
Thermodynamic Pump Testing
 

In a thermodynamic pump test setup, pressure monitoring is used to measure both the suction and discharge pressure of the pump. Accurate thermocouples are used to measure the difference between the suction and discharge temperatures of the pumped liquid. Power metering is setup to measure the pump motor input power.  

As in conventional testing the pump is run at operational speed and the discharge valve is progressively closed in steps to record measurements at a series of test points.  
 
The true flowrate at each point can be back-calculated from the pump head, temperature rise, power readings and known motor efficiency. In practice, readings are also normally taken from the site flowmeter at each test point that can be used to determine its accuracy.

The Advantages of the Thermodynamic Technique

•	Pump efficiency and performance can be accurately determined on-site
•	Accuracy is not sensitive to pipework configuration (accurate flow metering is sensitive to pipework configuration)
•	Portable testing equipment can be easily installed
•	Test work can be carried out with the minimum disruption to operations
•	Testing does not rely in existing installed flow metering equipment of variable accuracy

Magnitude of Temperature rise in Thermodynamic pump testing
 
On-site Pump Performance Testing

•	detect loss in performance and aid optimisation of maintenance intervals
•	assess the effectiveness of refurbishment work
o	it is economically viable to refurbish one out of every  three pump tested
o	paybacks on refurbishment are generally less than 2 years
•	optimise operating schedules to minimise operating costs
•	evaluate system losses and condition
•	assess fitness for purpose
•	calibrate permanently installed flowmeters

Variable Speed Control

 

The Pump Affinity Laws for Variable Speed Pumping

For a Speed Change (N1  N2)

Q2 = Q1 (N2 / N1)

Flowrate (Q) is directly proportional to speed.

H2 = H1 (N2 / N1)2

Head (H) is proportional to the square of speed.

P2 = P1 (N2 / N1)3

Power (P) is proportional to the cube of speed.

NPSHR2 = NPSHR1 (N2 / N1)2

Net Positive Suction Head Required (NPSHR) is proportional to the square of speed.
 
Variable Speed - No Static Head
 
Where there is no static head, the variable speed pump control will produce flow at all motor speeds.

Variable Speed – 60% Static Head
 
With significant static head contribution, operating points move to the left.  At slower speeds the pump doesn’t produce enough head to overcome static head and ‘hydraulic shut-off’ occurs.

Variable Speed Pumping

•	Variable speed control becomes less attractive as static head contribution increases
o	the pump operating point moves to the left of bep
o	flow becomes increasingly sensitive to small speed changes
•	Other options should be considered when static head exceeds 60% of total head required
 
Parallel Pumping
 
In a parallel pumping arrangement individual pumps have their own suction and discharge valves. 

Parallel Operation of Fixed Speed Pumps
 
Parallel Operation of Fixed Speed Pumps
 
If static head contribution is low, there is a danger of cavitation if one pump fails as flow through the remaining pump increases.
 

Parallel Operation of Fixed Speed Pumps

If one or more pumps fail in a parallel pumping arrangement, flow through the remaining pump(s) increases.
•	The effect becomes more significant as the static head contribution decreases.
•	If the operating point moves to the right of the bep efficiency is reduced and there is a risk of overloading the motor and a risk of high flow cavitation occurring.

Operating Variable Speed Pumps in Parallel

•	The characteristics of pumps operating in parallel must be carefully matched to prevent ‘hydraulic shut-off’
o	leading to overheating, high shaft forces and premature bearing and seal failure
•	Operating pumps running in parallel at different speeds is the easiest way to mismatch their characteristics

 
Variation in Impeller Forces with Pump Flow

 
Axial flow centrifugal pumps have a propeller type impeller.  
Volute casings are used for high head applications. The volute that surrounds the impeller periphery is a curved funnel that increases in cross-sectional area towards the discharge manifold.  As the area of the cross-section increases, the volute reduces the speed and increases the pressure of the liquid. 
One of the main purposes of a volute casing is to help balance the hydraulic pressure on the shaft of the pump. Balancing is maximised at the bep. Running volute-style pumps at a lower capacity than the bep can put lateral stress on the shaft of the pump, increasing wear-and-tear on the seals and bearings, and on the shaft itself.  Double-volute casings are used where radial thrusts become significant at reduced capacities
Circular casings are used for low head high capacity applications. Circular casing have stationary diffusion vanes surrounding the impeller periphery that convert velocity energy to pressure energy

 
Series Pumping

 

Operating Pumps in Series

•	The suction pressure of the second pump is equal to the discharge pressure of the first pump
•	If the first pump fails or cannot provide sufficient flow the second pump may cavitate
•	problems can occur when series pumping stations are remote from each other and not under common control

Pump Scheduling

•	There are often savings to be made from pump scheduling where there is
o	over-capacity
o	variable demand
o	sufficient storage capacity
o	variable energy tariffs
•	The selection of operating schedules are often based on minimal or out of date information


•	Compare the specific power consumption of installations and individual plant items
•	Obtain current pump and system operating characteristics
•	Review the operating schedules to identify cost saving opportunities
•	Implement revised operating schedules and train operators

 
Identifying Cost Savings Opportunities

 

Controlling Complex Systems

For energy intensive and complex systems with a high degree of interaction between individual assets continuous monitoring may be required to maintain efficiency

•	data accessed and analysed remotely.
•	provision of information, not just data.
•	customised control software
